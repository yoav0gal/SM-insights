          "summary (powered by concisegptConfusionhighlights:- definition of proxy war:  - a proxy war occurs when external parties instrumentalize a conflict, using it as a stand-in for their larger disputes.- advantages for great powers:  - proxy wars offer great powers deniability, allow them to avoid sacrificing their own citizens, and contain violence within another country's borders.- cold war examples:  - the korean war, vietnam war, and the conflict in afghanistan exemplify how the us and the soviet union used proxy wars to fight each other indirectly, spreading their influence and ideologies.- post-cold war shift:  - the end of the cold war did not reduce proxy wars; instead, they increased due to the rise of multiple global powers and the lower cost of supporting proxy forces.- modern proxy wars:  - conflicts in libya, syria, and sudan demonstrate how proxy wars have become longer, deadlier, and more resistant to peace due to multiple patrons supporting different factions.- ukraine as a half-proxy war:  - the conflict in ukraine is described as a \"half proxy war\" because while ukraine is supported by the west against russian aggression, russia itself is deeply engaged and views the conflict as existential.- china's approach:  - china has largely avoided engaging in proxy wars, adhering to a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, although this is being tested in situations like the civil war in myanmar.key insights:- changing nature of warfare:  - direct wars between major powers have become less common due to the threat of nuclear weapons, leading to the rise of proxy wars as the primary means of geopolitical competition.- increased complexity:  - modern proxy wars are more complex than those during the cold war due to the presence of multiple patrons, making conflicts harder to resolve and prolonging the violence.- deadly equilibrium:  - proxy wars often reach a \"dynamic equilibrium\" where external supporters provide just enough assistance to keep the conflict going but not enough to achieve a decisive victory, leading to protracted and devastating wars.- local perspectives:  - while proxy wars are often analyzed from the perspective of great powers, it's crucial to understand the motivations of local groups who may seek external support as a means of survival or to achieve their own objectives.- potential for escalation:  - the conflict in ukraine highlights the risk of escalation in proxy wars, especially when a major power views the outcome as existential, potentially leading to broader and more dangerous confrontations.```",

          "funny enough, i had this realization several months ago. actually if you go back to every major civil war, there is always some level of foreign influence or assistance, often by a country or side that is at odds with the country. and also, that every \"independence movement\" is actually very simply a civil war that was successful, and if it wasn't successful, we just refer to it as a civil war, without the romanticization of it being a fight for independence. but i guarantee you that any group that takes up arms against their own country is fighting for their independence and freedom and autonomy, to either separate from the country. there is always the side that fights for the country and its authority and dominance over the smaller group, and that group which wants to break away and have its own autonomy and freedom, and be free from what they see as an oppressive authority that makes laws against them they don't want.  another thing about nation states, there will always be winners and losers within the country, there are those who are subsidized (the recipient of more tax dollars than they payedConfusion and those who are subsidizees (the ones that pay more taxes than they receiveConfusion. for example, in america, there are mining towns in very sparsely populated states like idaho or montana that create insane amounts of wealth in a very small space, a single mining town. however, they are taxed very highly and see alot of that wealth go to the federal government, which then gets sent into cities and urban centers in all shapes and sizes, from low-income housing grants, to investment in infrastructure that only benefits those in cities, to student scholarship grants that only help those going to college. all of these things are payed for by people who will not benefit in any way from those policies. this is what creates and builds resentments inside a country by groups of people towards the central authority/government and becomes the source of a \"civil war\".  groups that feel being taken advantage of, and seeing a government that doesn't equally represent their interests based on their own notions of fairness.  as another example to that effect, there is a growing sentiment in america that the weight of someone's representation in the government should be based on how much you're putting in, like if you're in the class of people paying hundreds of thousands in taxes each year, you should have more representation in the government than a bunch of people who are paying zero dollars in taxes. this is a hotly contested issue ofcourse, but this difference in views about \"fairness\" is really the driving motivation for \"rebellious\" activity that can ultimately lead to \"civil war\" or physical conflict involving many armed skirmishes over weeks, months, years.  this is what the revolutionary war was in american against britain. it is also what the american civil war was, with the south against the north. there still exists sentiments in these highly productive smaller towns, whose labors support the financing and growth of the urban centers, but never see any reward or payoff for such things.  in some very indirect ways, maybe a new technological innovation in an urban center may occasionally offer benefits to these places to improve farming and agriculture practices, productivity, or mining safety, etc.  and this caveat might be the only thing that appeases those resentments, besides the threat of retaliation by the federal government.  but if everyone that payed more taxes than they got back unionized together into a single massive union, and threatened to stop paying their taxes in unison, this would essentially be a declaration of civil war, as it threatens the survival of the country bu threatening the authority of the country, which relies on that tax money to operate.  in any case, the realization that every civil war is also almost always instigated or assisted by a foreign power attempting to undermine the authority of that country, is a big realization. the us for example only broke awake from britain because france wanted to deprive them of the american colonies. it became the battle ground for a war between britain and france that had already been in fierce conflict in the past. this itself was a proxy war for them.  however, then france had its own civil war, so in some ways it could be seen as a group inside france was using american fight for independence as a way to get a foothold in american influence that would then support their own movement for independence, except not to break away from their own country, but to completely displace the current monarchy authority in place of their own selected authority, democracy! and they ended up with napoleon who for a short time adopted the name of king, and they treated him as if royalty.  not to get too off track though, it's important to simply realize there is always bigger forces at play when two smaller forces start fighting. it's an opportunity for the larger forces to find advantages against their rivals. any sort of power struggle or instability is seen as a way to build influence, to support a side, and if they win they become more friendly and favorable to you, and thus you have new allies in high places. the us has done this quite alot in south america and in the middle east. however when you support a side that loses, it really does not bode well for your image and world authority. makes you look bad, like a loser, and the people there will remember and resent you. this is happening in africa towards france, as russia displaces french military presence there and thus their influences there.",

from the overt favouritism of ww, disguised behind the \"nice sounding story\".the outsiders' strategy was always \"if a local/limited war on the continent expands, then the engineered long war scenario,\" and this was declared by the hegemon.  this is not different today than it was  years ago,  years ago, or  years ago. the outsiders who avoid avoiding war benefit if all others fight to mutual exhaustion. this will not be different today now that zelenski has recognized how he had been duped into the long war by boris johnson (istanbul proposals torpedoed, whilst \"blaming the other

achieving the beneficial division for the higher power are not important. for the dividing power, it does not matter how the division is implemented, or how existing divisions are deepened, or who is helping for whatever reasons, or whether those who favor and abet the division even know that they are supporting the division: what matters is that division is implemented. for the outside divider with a geographical advantage of distance from violent events, it is not important why the chosen tools choose to work together for the gains of the empire, but the fact that the chosen tools work together to create division and overwhelm a part of the planet somewhere. \"how\" and \"that\" are different premises.the empire is in search of profit, only \"interests\" are important. there are more than enough examples of strategists who openly admit this. the apologists will never address this, since they instinctively realize that they benefit from wars elsewhere. all these \"fence

at versailles. in case anybody doubts the validity of the above assessment i suggest a \"map\", upon which one can plot the encirclement of central europe after the s. maps are a primary source of

stood off and used their navies to \"nibble around the edges\" of russia, and later step in with systemic expansion, and systemic profit and gain. why is this a fact? because it actually happened.

          "i found out about this podcast because i was listening to brett weinstein attack what he calls fractures in the alliance for people who are under the umbrella of maha. although brret is usually  quite logical in his analysis but he's missing the point which is that one person can't be all things to all people and that's the same with the maja movement. he's not even in the new administration but bobby junior is and bobby junior would definitely be attacking the vaccine problem. as for who's attacking the food problem in the administration i'm not quite sure unless bobby is able to delegate that and maybe he'll bring on calley and casey means to spearhead that. mary  and jack are wrong-headed if they think that the callley and casey need to do this as well as put huge emphasis on the sick food system we have that is making our children sick. they can't do everything.",

          "you are all more on the same side than you are willing to see. the distrust that has been bred is very real and legit. transparency and spontaneous, emotional responses breed trust. the difference between straight shooters, and smooth-talkers is apparent here. having been inside the power bases and having to excuse and learn how to communicate in their ways, compromises ones ethics, and ability to be transparent.. i know this because i lived in and spied on them also, while having serious concerns about the longterm damage, agendas, and willful ignorance  that they swim in, and demand anyone inside to play along with.callie may not understand  how being inside those worlds has changed  him into soundy cagey, detached, and good at spinning and dodging...at times  condescending. but it has.while the dr is directly confrontive, and harsh, especially  around the death of callies mother, he is justifiably suspicious  of everything,  because he's lived enough, and experienced  enough, and has special knowledge  that is being hijacked and hidden.all of you have done a good job trying to argue out differences, but the two blind spots are fircing you to go round and round.one side is  being cagey and comfortable  with that \"spin\" way of sharing who he is, (even if it's to use the corrupt system in order to be allowed to continue  being listened toConfusion, who maybe out of lack of life experience,  is unwittingly connected to darker people, and dismissing any concern about those  and the other,  trying to connect dots that may not apply here..may not be deliberate  agendas by anyone to subvert transparency,..because that is going on in nefarious ways by powerful people,  and that is a conscious goal by people  who have done it, are doing it, and hide it.and he is doing it accusingly and  in an intimidating way.i do think that after watching for an hour,  i am bothered by the way callie is so controlled, and presents everything  after filtering through  what he wants us to hear.and that it does breed a feeling of truth-\"lite\" and less transparency...and misdirection.i love that he's gone on record and criticized pharma and food, and is trying to stop them from shortening more lives,  and harming the quality of life for us.that's brave.and definitely  feel the same for both drs here, about scathing criticisms of the cover up and harms by the medical industries and government. i trust them more. not because they are drs. and not because they don't make excuses for corrupt  people  and institutions.it's because they don't seem to have any hidden subtext, or spin to anything  they say. they don't measure and filter,  or distract away from the direct points  or questions like callie does.when you're seeing and responsible for saving lives, and you're old enough to experience  the gravity of that..and living thru  times where you were betrayed and shocked that your government  would lie and do harm...you have no time for spin, or lack of spontaneous  emotional  answers that get to the whole truth, fast.for them all to work together against the same enemies,  these issues will need to be worked thru, if they can be.i hope so.because we need cooperation,  and they mostly have the same (difficultConfusion goals that we have to  work together on, and get action on, to save lives.",

          "i'm only  minutes into this, but it strikes me that calley means is dealing with the political reality that rfk jr needs to be confirmed by the senate and cannot afford to be seen as a hardline anti-vaxxer. the unfortunate truth is that calley, rfk jr, and to some degree, trump have to play it cool until the time is right to expose and eliminate these harmful vaccines and the regimes that push them.  until then, we can do our best to exercise our freedom and not get the shots.",

          "summary (powered by concisegptConfusionhighlights:- definition of proxy war:  - a proxy war occurs when external parties instrumentalize a conflict, using it as a stand-in for their larger disputes.- advantages for great powers:  - proxy wars offer great powers deniability, allow them to avoid sacrificing their own citizens, and contain violence within another country's borders.- cold war examples:  - the korean war, vietnam war, and the conflict in afghanistan exemplify how the us and the soviet union used proxy wars to fight each other indirectly, spreading their influence and ideologies.- post-cold war shift:  - the end of the cold war did not reduce proxy wars; instead, they increased due to the rise of multiple global powers and the lower cost of supporting proxy forces.- modern proxy wars:  - conflicts in libya, syria, and sudan demonstrate how proxy wars have become longer, deadlier, and more resistant to peace due to multiple patrons supporting different factions.- ukraine as a half-proxy war:  - the conflict in ukraine is described as a \"half proxy war\" because while ukraine is supported by the west against russian aggression, russia itself is deeply engaged and views the conflict as existential.- china's approach:  - china has largely avoided engaging in proxy wars, adhering to a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, although this is being tested in situations like the civil war in myanmar.key insights:- changing nature of warfare:  - direct wars between major powers have become less common due to the threat of nuclear weapons, leading to the rise of proxy wars as the primary means of geopolitical competition.- increased complexity:  - modern proxy wars are more complex than those during the cold war due to the presence of multiple patrons, making conflicts harder to resolve and prolonging the violence.- deadly equilibrium:  - proxy wars often reach a \"dynamic equilibrium\" where external supporters provide just enough assistance to keep the conflict going but not enough to achieve a decisive victory, leading to protracted and devastating wars.- local perspectives:  - while proxy wars are often analyzed from the perspective of great powers, it's crucial to understand the motivations of local groups who may seek external support as a means of survival or to achieve their own objectives.- potential for escalation:  - the conflict in ukraine highlights the risk of escalation in proxy wars, especially when a major power views the outcome as existential, potentially leading to broader and more dangerous confrontations.```",

          "funny enough, i had this realization several months ago. actually if you go back to every major civil war, there is always some level of foreign influence or assistance, often by a country or side that is at odds with the country. and also, that every \"independence movement\" is actually very simply a civil war that was successful, and if it wasn't successful, we just refer to it as a civil war, without the romanticization of it being a fight for independence. but i guarantee you that any group that takes up arms against their own country is fighting for their independence and freedom and autonomy, to either separate from the country. there is always the side that fights for the country and its authority and dominance over the smaller group, and that group which wants to break away and have its own autonomy and freedom, and be free from what they see as an oppressive authority that makes laws against them they don't want.  another thing about nation states, there will always be winners and losers within the country, there are those who are subsidized (the recipient of more tax dollars than they payedConfusion and those who are subsidizees (the ones that pay more taxes than they receiveConfusion. for example, in america, there are mining towns in very sparsely populated states like idaho or montana that create insane amounts of wealth in a very small space, a single mining town. however, they are taxed very highly and see alot of that wealth go to the federal government, which then gets sent into cities and urban centers in all shapes and sizes, from low-income housing grants, to investment in infrastructure that only benefits those in cities, to student scholarship grants that only help those going to college. all of these things are payed for by people who will not benefit in any way from those policies. this is what creates and builds resentments inside a country by groups of people towards the central authority/government and becomes the source of a \"civil war\".  groups that feel being taken advantage of, and seeing a government that doesn't equally represent their interests based on their own notions of fairness.  as another example to that effect, there is a growing sentiment in america that the weight of someone's representation in the government should be based on how much you're putting in, like if you're in the class of people paying hundreds of thousands in taxes each year, you should have more representation in the government than a bunch of people who are paying zero dollars in taxes. this is a hotly contested issue ofcourse, but this difference in views about \"fairness\" is really the driving motivation for \"rebellious\" activity that can ultimately lead to \"civil war\" or physical conflict involving many armed skirmishes over weeks, months, years.  this is what the revolutionary war was in american against britain. it is also what the american civil war was, with the south against the north. there still exists sentiments in these highly productive smaller towns, whose labors support the financing and growth of the urban centers, but never see any reward or payoff for such things.  in some very indirect ways, maybe a new technological innovation in an urban center may occasionally offer benefits to these places to improve farming and agriculture practices, productivity, or mining safety, etc.  and this caveat might be the only thing that appeases those resentments, besides the threat of retaliation by the federal government.  but if everyone that payed more taxes than they got back unionized together into a single massive union, and threatened to stop paying their taxes in unison, this would essentially be a declaration of civil war, as it threatens the survival of the country bu threatening the authority of the country, which relies on that tax money to operate.  in any case, the realization that every civil war is also almost always instigated or assisted by a foreign power attempting to undermine the authority of that country, is a big realization. the us for example only broke awake from britain because france wanted to deprive them of the american colonies. it became the battle ground for a war between britain and france that had already been in fierce conflict in the past. this itself was a proxy war for them.  however, then france had its own civil war, so in some ways it could be seen as a group inside france was using american fight for independence as a way to get a foothold in american influence that would then support their own movement for independence, except not to break away from their own country, but to completely displace the current monarchy authority in place of their own selected authority, democracy! and they ended up with napoleon who for a short time adopted the name of king, and they treated him as if royalty.  not to get too off track though, it's important to simply realize there is always bigger forces at play when two smaller forces start fighting. it's an opportunity for the larger forces to find advantages against their rivals. any sort of power struggle or instability is seen as a way to build influence, to support a side, and if they win they become more friendly and favorable to you, and thus you have new allies in high places. the us has done this quite alot in south america and in the middle east. however when you support a side that loses, it really does not bode well for your image and world authority. makes you look bad, like a loser, and the people there will remember and resent you. this is happening in africa towards france, as russia displaces french military presence there and thus their influences there.",

          "you are all more on the same side than you are willing to see. the distrust that has been bred is very real and legit. transparency and spontaneous, emotional responses breed trust. the difference between straight shooters, and smooth-talkers is apparent here. having been inside the power bases and having to excuse and learn how to communicate in their ways, compromises ones ethics, and ability to be transparent.. i know this because i lived in and spied on them also, while having serious concerns about the longterm damage, agendas, and willful ignorance  that they swim in, and demand anyone inside to play along with.callie may not understand  how being inside those worlds has changed  him into soundy cagey, detached, and good at spinning and dodging...at times  condescending. but it has.while the dr is directly confrontive, and harsh, especially  around the death of callies mother, he is justifiably suspicious  of everything,  because he's lived enough, and experienced  enough, and has special knowledge  that is being hijacked and hidden.all of you have done a good job trying to argue out differences, but the two blind spots are fircing you to go round and round.one side is  being cagey and comfortable  with that \"spin\" way of sharing who he is, (even if it's to use the corrupt system in order to be allowed to continue  being listened toConfusion, who maybe out of lack of life experience,  is unwittingly connected to darker people, and dismissing any concern about those  and the other,  trying to connect dots that may not apply here..may not be deliberate  agendas by anyone to subvert transparency,..because that is going on in nefarious ways by powerful people,  and that is a conscious goal by people  who have done it, are doing it, and hide it.and he is doing it accusingly and  in an intimidating way.i do think that after watching for an hour,  i am bothered by the way callie is so controlled, and presents everything  after filtering through  what he wants us to hear.and that it does breed a feeling of truth-\"lite\" and less transparency...and misdirection.i love that he's gone on record and criticized pharma and food, and is trying to stop them from shortening more lives,  and harming the quality of life for us.that's brave.and definitely  feel the same for both drs here, about scathing criticisms of the cover up and harms by the medical industries and government. i trust them more. not because they are drs. and not because they don't make excuses for corrupt  people  and institutions.it's because they don't seem to have any hidden subtext, or spin to anything  they say. they don't measure and filter,  or distract away from the direct points  or questions like callie does.when you're seeing and responsible for saving lives, and you're old enough to experience  the gravity of that..and living thru  times where you were betrayed and shocked that your government  would lie and do harm...you have no time for spin, or lack of spontaneous  emotional  answers that get to the whole truth, fast.for them all to work together against the same enemies,  these issues will need to be worked thru, if they can be.i hope so.because we need cooperation,  and they mostly have the same (difficultConfusion goals that we have to  work together on, and get action on, to save lives.",

          "for dr mary to blame the lack of trust on non-medical person aka kelly on a person who they acknowledged has actually no medical degree and does not practice as a doctor a k e casey is heating the true situation which is that we do not trust her or jack because they are doctors. i do not trust any of my doctors but i have to go to them and every time they say something i research it and i find out they're wrong but it helps me because of my research to find out what i need and then i do it. that's what we have to do but i will say and i will agree with jack and mary that i do not trust them past my nose they are of the devil they are from the devil and they speak like the devil and if some people have been helped by them well thank god for that sometimes christ and the angels can intervene even with the devil.",

          "funny enough, i had this realization several months ago. actually if you go back to every major civil war, there is always some level of foreign influence or assistance, often by a country or side that is at odds with the country. and also, that every \"independence movement\" is actually very simply a civil war that was successful, and if it wasn't successful, we just refer to it as a civil war, without the romanticization of it being a fight for independence. but i guarantee you that any group that takes up arms against their own country is fighting for their independence and freedom and autonomy, to either separate from the country. there is always the side that fights for the country and its authority and dominance over the smaller group, and that group which wants to break away and have its own autonomy and freedom, and be free from what they see as an oppressive authority that makes laws against them they don't want.  another thing about nation states, there will always be winners and losers within the country, there are those who are subsidized (the recipient of more tax dollars than they payedConfusion and those who are subsidizees (the ones that pay more taxes than they receiveConfusion. for example, in america, there are mining towns in very sparsely populated states like idaho or montana that create insane amounts of wealth in a very small space, a single mining town. however, they are taxed very highly and see alot of that wealth go to the federal government, which then gets sent into cities and urban centers in all shapes and sizes, from low-income housing grants, to investment in infrastructure that only benefits those in cities, to student scholarship grants that only help those going to college. all of these things are payed for by people who will not benefit in any way from those policies. this is what creates and builds resentments inside a country by groups of people towards the central authority/government and becomes the source of a \"civil war\".  groups that feel being taken advantage of, and seeing a government that doesn't equally represent their interests based on their own notions of fairness.  as another example to that effect, there is a growing sentiment in america that the weight of someone's representation in the government should be based on how much you're putting in, like if you're in the class of people paying hundreds of thousands in taxes each year, you should have more representation in the government than a bunch of people who are paying zero dollars in taxes. this is a hotly contested issue ofcourse, but this difference in views about \"fairness\" is really the driving motivation for \"rebellious\" activity that can ultimately lead to \"civil war\" or physical conflict involving many armed skirmishes over weeks, months, years.  this is what the revolutionary war was in american against britain. it is also what the american civil war was, with the south against the north. there still exists sentiments in these highly productive smaller towns, whose labors support the financing and growth of the urban centers, but never see any reward or payoff for such things.  in some very indirect ways, maybe a new technological innovation in an urban center may occasionally offer benefits to these places to improve farming and agriculture practices, productivity, or mining safety, etc.  and this caveat might be the only thing that appeases those resentments, besides the threat of retaliation by the federal government.  but if everyone that payed more taxes than they got back unionized together into a single massive union, and threatened to stop paying their taxes in unison, this would essentially be a declaration of civil war, as it threatens the survival of the country bu threatening the authority of the country, which relies on that tax money to operate.  in any case, the realization that every civil war is also almost always instigated or assisted by a foreign power attempting to undermine the authority of that country, is a big realization. the us for example only broke awake from britain because france wanted to deprive them of the american colonies. it became the battle ground for a war between britain and france that had already been in fierce conflict in the past. this itself was a proxy war for them.  however, then france had its own civil war, so in some ways it could be seen as a group inside france was using american fight for independence as a way to get a foothold in american influence that would then support their own movement for independence, except not to break away from their own country, but to completely displace the current monarchy authority in place of their own selected authority, democracy! and they ended up with napoleon who for a short time adopted the name of king, and they treated him as if royalty.  not to get too off track though, it's important to simply realize there is always bigger forces at play when two smaller forces start fighting. it's an opportunity for the larger forces to find advantages against their rivals. any sort of power struggle or instability is seen as a way to build influence, to support a side, and if they win they become more friendly and favorable to you, and thus you have new allies in high places. the us has done this quite alot in south america and in the middle east. however when you support a side that loses, it really does not bode well for your image and world authority. makes you look bad, like a loser, and the people there will remember and resent you. this is happening in africa towards france, as russia displaces french military presence there and thus their influences there.",

britain was for rome around the year \"\": the technique used by both empires was the same, namely, exploiting existing divisions. exploiting such divisions for one's own ends is the \"divide-and-rule/conquer\" strategy. a proactive means of advancing one's own interests at the expense of others is to favor some (increase the power of the favouredConfusion at the expense of others (decrease the power of the outcastConfusion. in the initial stages while the uk kept its power to be the \"divider in in chief\" herself up to the s, washington dc did not have to engage much, apart from the overt favouritism of ww, disguised behind the \"nice sounding story\".the outsiders' strategy was always \"if a local/limited war on the continent expands, then the engineered long war scenario,\" and this was declared by the hegemon.  this is not different today than it was  years ago,  years ago, or  years ago. the outsiders who avoid avoiding war benefit if all others fight to mutual exhaustion. this will not be different today now that zelenski has recognized how he had been duped into the long war by boris johnson (istanbul proposals torpedoed, whilst \"blaming the other side\"Confusion. for the \"divider,\" sitting on the fence watching, the multitude of reasons, motivations, ideologies, justifications, opinions, excuses, or the interests of those who cooperate in achieving the beneficial division for the higher power are not important. for the dividing power, it does not matter how the division is implemented, or how existing divisions are deepened, or who is helping for whatever reasons, or whether those who favor and abet the division even know that they are supporting the division: what matters is that division is implemented. for the outside divider with a geographical advantage of distance from violent events, it is not important why the chosen tools choose to work together for the gains of the empire, but the fact that the chosen tools work together to create division and overwhelm a part of the planet somewhere. \"how\" and \"that\" are different premises.the empire is in search of profit, only \"interests\" are important. there are more than enough examples of strategists who openly admit this. the apologists will never address this, since they instinctively realize that they benefit from wars elsewhere. all these \"fence sitters\" have to do is wait for the crash, boom, bang, then sail in and benefit...the conflagration that took place after the s have a prequel in european history, in the events of the s up to  and at versailles. in case anybody doubts the validity of the above assessment i suggest a \"map\", upon which one can plot the encirclement of central europe after the s. maps are a primary source of information more valuable than words spoken by another human being, prone to lies and deception. this setup continued after ww, with the only change being that instead of a small number of large

\"good guys\" or \"on right side of history\" and being an \"indispensable nation\", the encirclers will never admit their own corruption because they feel better about the realities they have imposed on their neighbours either directly or by proxy, and do not intend to follow a simple moral logic of a strategy of power called the golden rule: \"don't do unto others what you do not want done to you.\"  do you want to be encircled and encroached upon? then do not do it to others. if you cannot follow such a simple logic, you must follow the logic of causality where there is a muddy trench

nothing else but systemic expansion, started in  and never stopped. an insatiable empire, hiding behind a narrative. fact is that during ww planners in london, washington dc and paris were already planning their war against russia in , as systemic expansion, and needed \"new best fwiends\" (eastern europeansConfusion to sacrifice as proxies, doing most of the fighting and dying, while they stood off and used their navies to \"nibble around the edges\" of russia, and later step in with systemic expansion, and systemic profit and gain. why is this a fact? because it actually happened. this habit of finding proxies to do most of the fighting and dying repeated after the s, looking for slavic people who could be set up against their neighbours. trust the albion once, and you are in its \"fangs\" forever...today?history is repeating.albion .anybody who \"believes\" ww/ww ever \"ended\" is already the fool, sacrificing himself for the systemic expansion and gain of \"friends\".imagine not knowing what ww and ww was about, and getting emotionally triggered every time your ideological standpoint is contested. ww and ww was about the destruction of the european

          "summary (powered by concisegptConfusionhighlights:- definition of proxy war:  - a proxy war occurs when external parties instrumentalize a conflict, using it as a stand-in for their larger disputes.- advantages for great powers:  - proxy wars offer great powers deniability, allow them to avoid sacrificing their own citizens, and contain violence within another country's borders.- cold war examples:  - the korean war, vietnam war, and the conflict in afghanistan exemplify how the us and the soviet union used proxy wars to fight each other indirectly, spreading their influence and ideologies.- post-cold war shift:  - the end of the cold war did not reduce proxy wars; instead, they increased due to the rise of multiple global powers and the lower cost of supporting proxy forces.- modern proxy wars:  - conflicts in libya, syria, and sudan demonstrate how proxy wars have become longer, deadlier, and more resistant to peace due to multiple patrons supporting different factions.- ukraine as a half-proxy war:  - the conflict in ukraine is described as a \"half proxy war\" because while ukraine is supported by the west against russian aggression, russia itself is deeply engaged and views the conflict as existential.- china's approach:  - china has largely avoided engaging in proxy wars, adhering to a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, although this is being tested in situations like the civil war in myanmar.key insights:- changing nature of warfare:  - direct wars between major powers have become less common due to the threat of nuclear weapons, leading to the rise of proxy wars as the primary means of geopolitical competition.- increased complexity:  - modern proxy wars are more complex than those during the cold war due to the presence of multiple patrons, making conflicts harder to resolve and prolonging the violence.- deadly equilibrium:  - proxy wars often reach a \"dynamic equilibrium\" where external supporters provide just enough assistance to keep the conflict going but not enough to achieve a decisive victory, leading to protracted and devastating wars.- local perspectives:  - while proxy wars are often analyzed from the perspective of great powers, it's crucial to understand the motivations of local groups who may seek external support as a means of survival or to achieve their own objectives.- potential for escalation:  - the conflict in ukraine highlights the risk of escalation in proxy wars, especially when a major power views the outcome as existential, potentially leading to broader and more dangerous confrontations.```",

          "i just tried to find dr jack kruse on the web to see what school he is so not famous that he's not on the web &  obviously did not go to harvard or stanford or he wouldn't be dissing them. i did find a doctor jack kruse who solved his health problem by food and he wrote a whole book on it and created a diet to help americans change their s*** way of eating so maybe he's jealous of that jack kruse  as well as this young man but i'm sick of old men being jealous and either sending out young man to die in war or beating them up in person on the web. i'm glad some of you say dr jack helped you but right now he is presenting himself as a doctor jekyll dr hyde.",
          "this is a great podcast. dr. mary has been through hell and back, in her practice so she represents a clear litmus test for evaluating anyone on the scene about \"jabs\". jack is a tribe leader and going to \"vet\" anyone on quite a few subjects. i know for a fact that i was mkultra'd in school and as a kid with the world of television and music. almost anyone in the working system of any schooling is a product of jd rockefeller's programing. in a sense people and families who lived through disney's effect on the world has been \"waterboarded\" and is thoroughly \"spellbound\". since getting a heck of a lot more sunshine in my life, i am getting clearer instructions for regaining my health. and the best way to \"come out of this trance from the elites\", sun is the only antidote.            it runs so deep that anyone, even calley means is unable to see how he fits the mold to a tee. time and his maturation regarding \"banning the realm of vaccinations\" on every level is tantamount. you want to know about where the program all started. it began with polio. it was never a virus. how do i know. well, i am a polio survivor who lived his life under that somnambulistic trance for the past  years. i was hospitalized when i was  in .              you want to know what polio is, where it came from, how it did what it did, well why the heck is anyone asking a doctor who never had the challenge, how to treat it? that is absurd. it reminds me of when a male doctor sees a female patient who is pregnant, and the male doctor blurs out that old familiar phrase...\"oh i see your pregnant, i know exactly how you feel\". no, you don't stupid, you're not a woman and there is no way to pretend you know how a woman \"feels\" in her female body, how could you. you want to know how polio feels? well, why not ask the patient who survived. i have the smoking gun regarding polio and its origins. i live in that dimension every single day and have done so, for the past  long years.        i am . you want to know about vaccines, ask me soon as i am getting older. i really need to present my evidence to elon musk and bobby kennidy with jack kruse as well. last year i woke up to the reality that i was diagnosed with polio way back then, when i was , and the life i have attempted to live, turned into a nightmare, because that life was spent in a stupor of handicap events, that my conscious mind was completely unaware of. i guess you could say, \"you had to be there, in my shoes to experience it, in order to believe it\".",
          "this is ridiculous.calley & casey means walked out of their respective careers because their eyes were opened to the devastating effects of pharma/food on their mother.  their mother. if they were weaker, less intelligent, less driven individuals (clearly inherited/taught - in part- by the same motherConfusion they wouldn't have walked away from the env'ts that caused her chronic disease and death. the timing of their efforts was perfect for gaining awareness & coincided with (likelyConfusion the biggest mass-awakening in us history. tucker then opened the floodgates when he interviewed calley.people who have been insiders & then had awakenings are exactly the people you should want on your side.  they are whistleblowers.who makes the best doctors? the ones who've woken up to the corruption & limitations of their own training in allopathic medicine, and retrain in functional med. this is exactly what casey means is, and calley is her analog from the pr/marketing world.jack's incessant unhinged & ludicrously conspiratorial attack just makes him look hysterical.mary's rage after her treatment at the hands of houston methodist and the tx medical board is completely understandable, but pointing fingers at calley because he happened to have effectively the same awakening as her but has been more successful smacks of envy.",
          "for dr mary to blame the lack of trust on non-medical person aka kelly on a person who they acknowledged has actually no medical degree and does not practice as a doctor a k e casey is heating the true situation which is that we do not trust her or jack because they are doctors. i do not trust any of my doctors but i have to go to them and every time they say something i research it and i find out they're wrong but it helps me because of my research to find out what i need and then i do it. that's what we have to do but i will say and i will agree with jack and mary that i do not trust them past my nose they are of the devil they are from the devil and they speak like the devil and if some people have been helped by them well thank god for that sometimes christ and the angels can intervene even with the devil.",
          "nah buddy, everybody doesn't \"have their inner-wounded-child\", haha damn.  you are something else. all you gotta do is a little research and you'll learn, there are actually only a very few of us, who actually have pain that's important.    i can't believe i'm being oppressed like this.",
          "man... i'm only / of the way through this and it's hard to listen to. i commend calley for coming on to the podcast, so far it's tough to hear him seemingly skirting important issues. i'm not really familiar yet with him or his sister, though i know they're suddenly everywhere and my wife read their book. why he won't even give a clear answer on why he doesn't feel the \"you know whats\" should be immediately banned is very troubling. dr jack kruse is extremely impressive. i wouldn't want to ever get on his bad side and have to debate him.",
          "dr jack has the veil threat when he talks about casey and the fact she does not have a medical license and he doesn't say the silent part which is that she's practicing medicine and he doesn't say it because she's not practicing medicine she never said that eating an egg instead of fruit loops would cure you of anything i've been through this a million times because i belong to alternative health entities decades before dr jack ever got on this mrna bandwagon which she's ready to hell and back. you can't say it cures but you can say it makes you feel better etcetera etcetera. the veil threat shows that guy is evil and i'm glad if he's helping people medically speaking because evil always as he can tell you right now surrounds itself with good and that's what he's trying to say that kelly who is a very naive young man is doing but i can see he's not doing that he's not as clever as evil jack because when you make a an agreement with the devil he gives you he does give you certain high-level means to function and to achieve your goal and it's very sad that dr jack is a doctor because he has his evil streak which is so obvious if you've ever been around evil you know it.",
          "dr jack is just being rude and shutting off my willingness to even give him an inch of credibility.",
          "i hope the retired dr jack who they brought back like you do with an  old greyhound who's past  prime is aware that nobody in the comments have agreed that what he says about rockefeller and this young man holds water. if he was their doctor and he helped them, they thanked him, and that's it. so i wish this jack would get off his pedestal of old man wants to beat up young man because he never got to the position that he thought he deserved in life. jack is straight through bs. . i'm glad he's able to do a thing or two regarding healing people but frankly considering the level of the playing field it's not much.",
          "this jack i exposes his complete madness when he says that's not what this guy jack is talking about i'm thinking isn't that jack talking cuz i'm doing dishes and i look yes it's dr jack talking so just be aware that we have a madman interrogating this very naive young man and also be aware that the other doctor mary is not a young woman he calls her young woman she's not she's middle-aged. i know you guys appreciate his balls and maybe you want to eat them for dinner i don't know i don't care but just be aware that this is a bunch of b***** to try to get his name out there because he's jealous as men often are of another man especially a younger man who is taking over his territory and you serving any possibility of fame he might have which is important to note because he doesn't have fame it's only a possibility that exist in his mad mind. put that in your pipe and smoke it grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes",
          "yeah if he knew who he was really working for that is a moral compromise for evil, not against it. thank you dr. jack for your diligent truths and exposing the fruits of labor this man produces!",
          "it's pretty interesting _ the comments are even more interesting but i don't understand why people can't be  christian. a christian -- as opposed to a jew or a muslim or an atheist which is probably what jack is-- xtan & does  forgive. this guy callie definitely was on the side of darkness and he still has a lot of the mannerisms of those people and that's not  debatable  but the fact of the matter is he chose to be on the side of light due to his sister's influence and i don't think that it should be held against him that once he was in darkness but now he no longer is. dr jack is in darkness in his own way because he interrogates as if he is the romans nailing christ to the cross. i'm not impressed with jack the interrogator and the screaming mary.",
          "i think when you put health into the conversation and your personal goal behinds paying off school debt, getting rich. you automatically go to the dark side. i think dr. jack and this awesome lady who is a ent has the perfect approach",
          "i did some research about dr. jack, he's very knowledgeable. his anger during this interview does not show it.",
          "i can understand skepticism of the mean's but jack is unnecessarily aggressive throughout the conversation.  seriously pulling there mother death certificate and attacking him.     maybe jack is a great doctor but he sure is an asshole.",

          "summary (powered by concisegptConfusionhighlights:- definition of proxy war:  - a proxy war occurs when external parties instrumentalize a conflict, using it as a stand-in for their larger disputes.- advantages for great powers:  - proxy wars offer great powers deniability, allow them to avoid sacrificing their own citizens, and contain violence within another country's borders.- cold war examples:  - the korean war, vietnam war, and the conflict in afghanistan exemplify how the us and the soviet union used proxy wars to fight each other indirectly, spreading their influence and ideologies.- post-cold war shift:  - the end of the cold war did not reduce proxy wars; instead, they increased due to the rise of multiple global powers and the lower cost of supporting proxy forces.- modern proxy wars:  - conflicts in libya, syria, and sudan demonstrate how proxy wars have become longer, deadlier, and more resistant to peace due to multiple patrons supporting different factions.- ukraine as a half-proxy war:  - the conflict in ukraine is described as a \"half proxy war\" because while ukraine is supported by the west against russian aggression, russia itself is deeply engaged and views the conflict as existential.- china's approach:  - china has largely avoided engaging in proxy wars, adhering to a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, although this is being tested in situations like the civil war in myanmar.key insights:- changing nature of warfare:  - direct wars between major powers have become less common due to the threat of nuclear weapons, leading to the rise of proxy wars as the primary means of geopolitical competition.- increased complexity:  - modern proxy wars are more complex than those during the cold war due to the presence of multiple patrons, making conflicts harder to resolve and prolonging the violence.- deadly equilibrium:  - proxy wars often reach a \"dynamic equilibrium\" where external supporters provide just enough assistance to keep the conflict going but not enough to achieve a decisive victory, leading to protracted and devastating wars.- local perspectives:  - while proxy wars are often analyzed from the perspective of great powers, it's crucial to understand the motivations of local groups who may seek external support as a means of survival or to achieve their own objectives.- potential for escalation:  - the conflict in ukraine highlights the risk of escalation in proxy wars, especially when a major power views the outcome as existential, potentially leading to broader and more dangerous confrontations.```",

          "funny enough, i had this realization several months ago. actually if you go back to every major civil war, there is always some level of foreign influence or assistance, often by a country or side that is at odds with the country. and also, that every \"independence movement\" is actually very simply a civil war that was successful, and if it wasn't successful, we just refer to it as a civil war, without the romanticization of it being a fight for independence. but i guarantee you that any group that takes up arms against their own country is fighting for their independence and freedom and autonomy, to either separate from the country. there is always the side that fights for the country and its authority and dominance over the smaller group, and that group which wants to break away and have its own autonomy and freedom, and be free from what they see as an oppressive authority that makes laws against them they don't want.  another thing about nation states, there will always be winners and losers within the country, there are those who are subsidized (the recipient of more tax dollars than they payedConfusion and those who are subsidizees (the ones that pay more taxes than they receiveConfusion. for example, in america, there are mining towns in very sparsely populated states like idaho or montana that create insane amounts of wealth in a very small space, a single mining town. however, they are taxed very highly and see alot of that wealth go to the federal government, which then gets sent into cities and urban centers in all shapes and sizes, from low-income housing grants, to investment in infrastructure that only benefits those in cities, to student scholarship grants that only help those going to college. all of these things are payed for by people who will not benefit in any way from those policies. this is what creates and builds resentments inside a country by groups of people towards the central authority/government and becomes the source of a \"civil war\".  groups that feel being taken advantage of, and seeing a government that doesn't equally represent their interests based on their own notions of fairness.  as another example to that effect, there is a growing sentiment in america that the weight of someone's representation in the government should be based on how much you're putting in, like if you're in the class of people paying hundreds of thousands in taxes each year, you should have more representation in the government than a bunch of people who are paying zero dollars in taxes. this is a hotly contested issue ofcourse, but this difference in views about \"fairness\" is really the driving motivation for \"rebellious\" activity that can ultimately lead to \"civil war\" or physical conflict involving many armed skirmishes over weeks, months, years.  this is what the revolutionary war was in american against britain. it is also what the american civil war was, with the south against the north. there still exists sentiments in these highly productive smaller towns, whose labors support the financing and growth of the urban centers, but never see any reward or payoff for such things.  in some very indirect ways, maybe a new technological innovation in an urban center may occasionally offer benefits to these places to improve farming and agriculture practices, productivity, or mining safety, etc.  and this caveat might be the only thing that appeases those resentments, besides the threat of retaliation by the federal government.  but if everyone that payed more taxes than they got back unionized together into a single massive union, and threatened to stop paying their taxes in unison, this would essentially be a declaration of civil war, as it threatens the survival of the country bu threatening the authority of the country, which relies on that tax money to operate.  in any case, the realization that every civil war is also almost always instigated or assisted by a foreign power attempting to undermine the authority of that country, is a big realization. the us for example only broke awake from britain because france wanted to deprive them of the american colonies. it became the battle ground for a war between britain and france that had already been in fierce conflict in the past. this itself was a proxy war for them.  however, then france had its own civil war, so in some ways it could be seen as a group inside france was using american fight for independence as a way to get a foothold in american influence that would then support their own movement for independence, except not to break away from their own country, but to completely displace the current monarchy authority in place of their own selected authority, democracy! and they ended up with napoleon who for a short time adopted the name of king, and they treated him as if royalty.  not to get too off track though, it's important to simply realize there is always bigger forces at play when two smaller forces start fighting. it's an opportunity for the larger forces to find advantages against their rivals. any sort of power struggle or instability is seen as a way to build influence, to support a side, and if they win they become more friendly and favorable to you, and thus you have new allies in high places. the us has done this quite alot in south america and in the middle east. however when you support a side that loses, it really does not bode well for your image and world authority. makes you look bad, like a loser, and the people there will remember and resent you. this is happening in africa towards france, as russia displaces french military presence there and thus their influences there.",

britain was for rome around the year \"\": the technique used by both empires was the same, namely, exploiting existing divisions. exploiting such divisions for one's own ends is the \"divide-and-rule/conquer\" strategy. a proactive means of advancing one's own interests at the expense of others is to favor some (increase the power of the favouredConfusion at the expense of others (decrease the power of the outcastConfusion. in the initial stages while the uk kept its power to be the \"divider in in chief\" herself up to the s, washington dc did not have to engage much, apart from the overt favouritism of ww, disguised behind the \"nice sounding story\".the outsiders' strategy was always \"if a local/limited war on the continent expands, then the engineered long war scenario,\" and this was declared by the hegemon.  this is not different today than it was  years ago,  years ago, or  years ago. the outsiders who avoid avoiding war benefit if all others fight to mutual exhaustion. this will not be different today now that zelenski has recognized how he had been duped into the long war by boris johnson (istanbul proposals torpedoed, whilst \"blaming the other side\"Confusion. for the \"divider,\" sitting on the fence watching, the multitude of reasons, motivations, ideologies, justifications, opinions, excuses, or the interests of those who cooperate in achieving the beneficial division for the higher power are not important. for the dividing power, it does not matter how the division is implemented, or how existing divisions are deepened, or who is helping for whatever reasons, or whether those who favor and abet the division even know that they are supporting the division: what matters is that division is implemented. for the outside divider with a geographical advantage of distance from violent events, it is not important why the chosen tools choose to work together for the gains of the empire, but the fact that the chosen tools work together to create division and overwhelm a part of the planet somewhere. \"how\" and \"that\" are different premises.the empire is in search of profit, only \"interests\" are important. there are more than enough examples of strategists who openly admit this. the apologists will never address this, since they instinctively realize that they benefit from wars elsewhere. all these \"fence sitters\" have to do is wait for the crash, boom, bang, then sail in and benefit...the conflagration that took place after the s have a prequel in european history, in the events of the s up to  and at versailles. in case anybody doubts the validity of the above assessment i suggest a \"map\", upon which one can plot the encirclement of central europe after the s. maps are a primary source of information more valuable than words spoken by another human being, prone to lies and deception. this setup continued after ww, with the only change being that instead of a small number of large

\"good guys\" or \"on right side of history\" and being an \"indispensable nation\", the encirclers will never admit their own corruption because they feel better about the realities they have imposed on their neighbours either directly or by proxy, and do not intend to follow a simple moral logic of a strategy of power called the golden rule: \"don't do unto others what you do not want done to you.\"  do you want to be encircled and encroached upon? then do not do it to others. if you cannot follow such a simple logic, you must follow the logic of causality where there is a muddy trench

planning their war against russia in , as systemic expansion, and needed \"new best fwiends\" (eastern europeansConfusion to sacrifice as proxies, doing most of the fighting and dying, while they stood off and used their navies to \"nibble around the edges\" of russia, and later step in with systemic expansion, and systemic profit and gain. why is this a fact? because it actually happened. this habit of finding proxies to do most of the fighting and dying repeated after the s, looking for slavic people who could be set up against their neighbours. trust the albion once, and you are in

balance of power, est. , and this destruction was carried out by outside ideologues, who entered europe \"trojan horse\"-style, initially into the uk and france (destruction of the reign of monarchy,
