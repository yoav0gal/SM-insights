          "summary powered by concisegpthighlights definition of proxy war   a proxy war occurs when external parties instrumentalize a conflict using it as a standin for their larger disputes advantages for great powers   proxy wars offer great powers deniability allow them to avoid sacrificing their own citizens and contain violence within another countrys borders cold war examples   the korean war vietnam war and the conflict in afghanistan exemplify how the us and the soviet union used proxy wars to fight each other indirectly spreading their influence and ideologies postcold war shift   the end of the cold war did not reduce proxy wars instead they increased due to the rise of multiple global powers and the lower cost of supporting proxy forces modern proxy wars   conflicts in libya syria and sudan demonstrate how proxy wars have become longer deadlier and more resistant to peace due to multiple patrons supporting different factions ukraine as a halfproxy war   the conflict in ukraine is described as a half proxy war because while ukraine is supported by the west against russian aggression russia itself is deeply engaged and views the conflict as existential chinas approach   china has largely avoided engaging in proxy wars adhering to a policy of noninterference in the internal affairs of other countries although this is being tested in situations like the civil war in myanmarkey insights changing nature of warfare   direct wars between major powers have become less common due to the threat of nuclear weapons leading to the rise of proxy wars as the primary means of geopolitical competition increased complexity   modern proxy wars are more complex than those during the cold war due to the presence of multiple patrons making conflicts harder to resolve and prolonging the violence deadly equilibrium   proxy wars often reach a dynamic equilibrium where external supporters provide just enough assistance to keep the conflict going but not enough to achieve a decisive victory leading to protracted and devastating wars local perspectives   while proxy wars are often analyzed from the perspective of great powers its crucial to understand the motivations of local groups who may seek external support as a means of survival or to achieve their own objectives potential for escalation   the conflict in ukraine highlights the risk of escalation in proxy wars especially when a major power views the outcome as existential potentially leading to broader and more dangerous confrontations",

          "history rhymesthe events later called world wars i and ii were part of the same conflagration that began around  when the naval powers encircled their continental neighbours for the american century after  sitting on the globes biggest fence atlantic oceandistance while eating popcorn waiting game europe was simply a slightly larger area than britain was for rome around the year  the technique used by both empires was the same namely exploiting existing divisions exploiting such divisions for ones own ends is the divideandruleconquer strategy a proactive means of advancing ones own interests at the expense of others is to favor some increase the power of the favoured at the expense of others decrease the power of the outcast in the initial stages while the uk kept its power to be the divider in in chief herself up to the s washington dc did not have to engage much apart from the overt favouritism of ww disguised behind the nice sounding storythe outsiders strategy was always if a locallimited war on the continent expands then the engineered long war scenario and this was declared by the hegemon  this is not different today than it was  years ago  years ago or  years ago the outsiders who avoid avoiding war benefit if all others fight to mutual exhaustion this will not be different today now that zelenski has recognized how he had been duped into the long war by boris johnson istanbul proposals torpedoed whilst blaming the other side for the divider sitting on the fence watching the multitude of reasons motivations ideologies justifications opinions excuses or the interests of those who cooperate in achieving the beneficial division for the higher power are not important for the dividing power it does not matter how the division is implemented or how existing divisions are deepened or who is helping for whatever reasons or whether those who favor and abet the division even know that they are supporting the division what matters is that division is implemented for the outside divider with a geographical advantage of distance from violent events it is not important why the chosen tools choose to work together for the gains of the empire but the fact that the chosen tools work together to create division and overwhelm a part of the planet somewhere how and that are different premisesthe empire is in search of profit only interests are important there are more than enough examples of strategists who openly admit this the apologists will never address this since they instinctively realize that they benefit from wars elsewhere all these fence sitters have to do is wait for the crash boom bang then sail in and benefitthe conflagration that took place after the s have a prequel in european history in the events of the s up to  and at versailles in case anybody doubts the validity of the above assessment i suggest a map upon which one can plot the encirclement of central europe after the s maps are a primary source of information more valuable than words spoken by another human being prone to lies and deception this setup continued after ww with the only change being that instead of a small number of large encirclers pre there were now a large number of small encirclers post the world war after  was another european year war with a year break in between the divisions thus established around the year  were the naval powers britainusa with their continental allies as buck catchers such as france after  and russia after  favouring long warsset up against the continental alliances favouring short wars which were encircled and prevented from reaching sufficient spheres of influence for their growth by the naval supremacy of  and this encirclement strategy began as a deliberate action by the naval powers around the albion used its unassailable geographical location on the map to play games not only in europe but globallydivideandgain power for own systemsif notdivideandcontrol a situation from the high groundif notdivideandrule by drawing lines on the map weakening others etcif notdivideandconquer markets sphere of influence whateverif notdivideanddestroy those who refuse to bow down to exploitation and divisionthis strategy was simply repeated after a short respite called the cold war  with the s wolfowitz doctrineus imperialist claim to power with us primacy as the top priority and yugoslavian unity the first victim on the marching route  written down in strategy papers for all to see this time around the targets of the global strategy of divideandrule were not central europecentral powers treaty of versailles and others but rather china and russia the new default rivals were shifted further east the final goal of our offcontinental noneurasian friends in washington dc is to crush china as they once crushed europe then carve it up into little pieces like they did with europe via their friends the uk and france london and paris using the block mentality of blockheads in the form of divided neighbours as tools on a chessboard and later claim total innocence and world saviourstatus for themselves after a short halt called cold war the march of the empire continued on the marching route of the empire which started when the ussr economically faltered in the latessystemicideological expansion into as concerted effort called divideandrule eastern europe balkansblack seacaucasus region southern pincer of advance balticscandinavia northern pincer of advancethis was simply the continuation of the scheme to overpower russia which dated from ww to make use of the weakness created by  years of war eastern front exhausting and extending all therefore it was never in the interest of the victors to achieve a fair balance of powers in europe as was the case in  balance of powerconcert of europe the intention was to create an imbalance of powers as foundation which could be exploited regardless of what the political doves thought they were doing keep on marching marching and when there is a reaction or resistance aka defensive realism by those encroached upon or encircled get the propagandists to start pointing fingers narrative control at those being encircled or encroached upon  this type of imperialist behaviour as evident by washington dc and their subservient collective westnato did not only start after ww ask the first nations or mexicobecause of the own ideological indoctrination something gladly attributed to others aka finger pointing and proudly stated by such tropes as being good guys or on right side of history and being an indispensable nation the encirclers will never admit their own corruption because they feel better about the realities they have imposed on their neighbours either directly or by proxy and do not intend to follow a simple moral logic of a strategy of power called the golden rule dont do unto others what you do not want done to you  do you want to be encircled and encroached upon then do not do it to others if you cannot follow such a simple logic you must follow the logic of causality where there is a muddy trench waiting for you  note not these socalled leaders who deceive you here for you personally the one reading this the bunker boys and manipulators are safely tucked away in the bunkers chanting slogans from their mommys basements or hiding behind their keyboards keyboard warriors hoping theyll never end up where they cheer forthe current greenland narrative is nothing else but systemic expansion started in  and never stopped an insatiable empire hiding behind a narrative fact is that during ww planners in london washington dc and paris were already planning their war against russia in  as systemic expansion and needed new best fwiends eastern europeans to sacrifice as proxies doing most of the fighting and dying while they stood off and used their navies to nibble around the edges of russia and later step in with systemic expansion and systemic profit and gain why is this a fact because it actually happened this habit of finding proxies to do most of the fighting and dying repeated after the s looking for slavic people who could be set up against their neighbours trust the albion once and you are in its fangs forevertodayhistory is repeatingalbion anybody who believes wwww ever ended is already the fool sacrificing himself for the systemic expansion and gain of friendsimagine not knowing what ww and ww was about and getting emotionally triggered every time your ideological standpoint is contested ww and ww was about the destruction of the european balance of power est  and this destruction was carried out by outside ideologues who entered europe trojan horsestyle initially into the uk and france destruction of the reign of monarchy sold to the plebs as an advantage and other countries on the fringes of europe intent on systemic gain they used tools aka proxies to do most of the fighting and dying for them the treaty of versailles was the first attempt to keep germany down in europeanglobal affairs russia out of europeanglobal affairs and the usa in lord ismay europeanglobal affairs it only failed because the usa did

          "funny enough i had this realization several months ago actually if you go back to every major civil war there is always some level of foreign influence or assistance often by a country or side that is at odds with the country and also that every independence movement is actually very simply a civil war that was successful and if it wasnt successful we just refer to it as a civil war without the romanticization of it being a fight for independence but i guarantee you that any group that takes up arms against their own country is fighting for their independence and freedom and autonomy to either separate from the country there is always the side that fights for the country and its authority and dominance over the smaller group and that group which wants to break away and have its own autonomy and freedom and be free from what they see as an oppressive authority that makes laws against them they dont want  another thing about nation states there will always be winners and losers within the country there are those who are subsidized the recipient of more tax dollars than they payed and those who are subsidizees the ones that pay more taxes than they receive for example in america there are mining towns in very sparsely populated states like idaho or montana that create insane amounts of wealth in a very small space a single mining town however they are taxed very highly and see alot of that wealth go to the federal government which then gets sent into cities and urban centers in all shapes and sizes from lowincome housing grants to investment in infrastructure that only benefits those in cities to student scholarship grants that only help those going to college all of these things are payed for by people who will not benefit in any way from those policies this is what creates and builds resentments inside a country by groups of people towards the central authoritygovernment and becomes the source of a civil war  groups that feel being taken advantage of and seeing a government that doesnt equally represent their interests based on their own notions of fairness  as another example to that effect there is a growing sentiment in america that the weight of someones representation in the government should be based on how much youre putting in like if youre in the class of people paying hundreds of thousands in taxes each year you should have more representation in the government than a bunch of people who are paying zero dollars in taxes this is a hotly contested issue ofcourse but this difference in views about fairness is really the driving motivation for rebellious activity that can ultimately lead to civil war or physical conflict involving many armed skirmishes over weeks months years  this is what the revolutionary war was in american against britain it is also what the american civil war was with the south against the north there still exists sentiments in these highly productive smaller towns whose labors support the financing and growth of the urban centers but never see any reward or payoff for such things  in some very indirect ways maybe a new technological innovation in an urban center may occasionally offer benefits to these places to improve farming and agriculture practices productivity or mining safety etc  and this caveat might be the only thing that appeases those resentments besides the threat of retaliation by the federal government  but if everyone that payed more taxes than they got back unionized together into a single massive union and threatened to stop paying their taxes in unison this would essentially be a declaration of civil war as it threatens the survival of the country bu threatening the authority of the country which relies on that tax money to operate  in any case the realization that every civil war is also almost always instigated or assisted by a foreign power attempting to undermine the authority of that country is a big realization the us for example only broke awake from britain because france wanted to deprive them of the american colonies it became the battle ground for a war between britain and france that had already been in fierce conflict in the past this itself was a proxy war for them  however then france had its own civil war so in some ways it could be seen as a group inside france was using american fight for independence as a way to get a foothold in american influence that would then support their own movement for independence except not to break away from their own country but to completely displace the current monarchy authority in place of their own selected authority democracy and they ended up with napoleon who for a short time adopted the name of king and they treated him as if royalty  not to get too off track though its important to simply realize there is always bigger forces at play when two smaller forces start fighting its an opportunity for the larger forces to find advantages against their rivals any sort of power struggle or instability is seen as a way to build influence to support a side and if they win they become more friendly and favorable to you and thus you have new allies in high places the us has done this quite alot in south america and in the middle east however when you support a side that loses it really does not bode well for your image and world authority makes you look bad like a loser and the people there will remember and resent you this is happening in africa towards france as russia displaces french military presence there and thus their influences there",

          "history rhymesthe events later called world wars i and ii were part of the same conflagration that began around  when the naval powers encircled their continental neighbours for the american century after  sitting on the globes biggest fence atlantic oceandistance while eating popcorn waiting game europe was simply a slightly larger area than britain was for rome around the year  the technique used by both empires was the same namely exploiting existing divisions exploiting such divisions for ones own ends is the divideandruleconquer strategy a proactive means of advancing ones own interests at the expense of others is to favor some increase the power of the favoured at the expense of others decrease the power of the outcast in the initial stages while the uk kept its power to be the divider in in chief herself up to the s washington dc did not have to engage much apart from the overt favouritism of ww disguised behind the nice sounding storythe outsiders strategy was always if a locallimited war on the continent expands then the engineered long war scenario and this was declared by the hegemon  this is not different today than it was  years ago  years ago or  years ago the outsiders who avoid avoiding war benefit if all others fight to mutual exhaustion this will not be different today now that zelenski has recognized how he had been duped into the long war by boris johnson istanbul proposals torpedoed whilst blaming the other side for the divider sitting on the fence watching the multitude of reasons motivations ideologies justifications opinions excuses or the interests of those who cooperate in achieving the beneficial division for the higher power are not important for the dividing power it does not matter how the division is implemented or how existing divisions are deepened or who is helping for whatever reasons or whether those who favor and abet the division even know that they are supporting the division what matters is that division is implemented for the outside divider with a geographical advantage of distance from violent events it is not important why the chosen tools choose to work together for the gains of the empire but the fact that the chosen tools work together to create division and overwhelm a part of the planet somewhere how and that are different premisesthe empire is in search of profit only interests are important there are more than enough examples of strategists who openly admit this the apologists will never address this since they instinctively realize that they benefit from wars elsewhere all these fence sitters have to do is wait for the crash boom bang then sail in and benefitthe conflagration that took place after the s have a prequel in european history in the events of the s up to  and at versailles in case anybody doubts the validity of the above assessment i suggest a map upon which one can plot the encirclement of central europe after the s maps are a primary source of information more valuable than words spoken by another human being prone to lies and deception this setup continued after ww with the only change being that instead of a small number of large encirclers pre there were now a large number of small encirclers post the world war after  was another european year war with a year break in between the divisions thus established around the year  were the naval powers britainusa with their continental allies as buck catchers such as france after  and russia after  favouring long warsset up against the continental alliances favouring short wars which were encircled and prevented from reaching sufficient spheres of influence for their growth by the naval supremacy of  and this encirclement strategy began as a deliberate action by the naval powers around the albion used its unassailable geographical location on the map to play games not only in europe but globallydivideandgain power for own systemsif notdivideandcontrol a situation from the high groundif notdivideandrule by drawing lines on the map weakening others etcif notdivideandconquer markets sphere of influence whateverif notdivideanddestroy those who refuse to bow down to exploitation and divisionthis strategy was simply repeated after a short respite called the cold war  with the s wolfowitz doctrineus imperialist claim to power with us primacy as the top priority and yugoslavian unity the first victim on the marching route  written down in strategy papers for all to see this time around the targets of the global strategy of divideandrule were not central europecentral powers treaty of versailles and others but rather china and russia the new default rivals were shifted further east the final goal of our offcontinental noneurasian friends in washington dc is to crush china as they once crushed europe then carve it up into little pieces like they did with europe via their friends the uk and france london and paris using the block mentality of blockheads in the form of divided neighbours as tools on a chessboard and later claim total innocence and world saviourstatus for themselves after a short halt called cold war the march of the empire continued on the marching route of the empire which started when the ussr economically faltered in the latessystemicideological expansion into as concerted effort called divideandrule eastern europe balkansblack seacaucasus region southern pincer of advance balticscandinavia northern pincer of advancethis was simply the continuation of the scheme to overpower russia which dated from ww to make use of the weakness created by  years of war eastern front exhausting and extending all therefore it was never in the interest of the victors to achieve a fair balance of powers in europe as was the case in  balance of powerconcert of europe the intention was to create an imbalance of powers as foundation which could be exploited regardless of what the political doves thought they were doing keep on marching marching and when there is a reaction or resistance aka defensive realism by those encroached upon or encircled get the propagandists to start pointing fingers narrative control at those being encircled or encroached upon  this type of imperialist behaviour as evident by washington dc and their subservient collective westnato did not only start after ww ask the first nations or mexicobecause of the own ideological indoctrination something gladly attributed to others aka finger pointing and proudly stated by such tropes as being good guys or on right side of history and being an indispensable nation the encirclers will never admit their own corruption because they feel better about the realities they have imposed on their neighbours either directly or by proxy and do not intend to follow a simple moral logic of a strategy of power called the golden rule dont do unto others what you do not want done to you  do you want to be encircled and encroached upon then do not do it to others if you cannot follow such a simple logic you must follow the logic of causality where there is a muddy trench waiting for you  note not these socalled leaders who deceive you here for you personally the one reading this the bunker boys and manipulators are safely tucked away in the bunkers chanting slogans from their mommys basements or hiding behind their keyboards keyboard warriors hoping theyll never end up where they cheer forthe current greenland narrative is nothing else but systemic expansion started in  and never stopped an insatiable empire hiding behind a narrative fact is that during ww planners in london washington dc and paris were already planning their war against russia in  as systemic expansion and needed new best fwiends eastern europeans to sacrifice as proxies doing most of the fighting and dying while they stood off and used their navies to nibble around the edges of russia and later step in with systemic expansion and systemic profit and gain why is this a fact because it actually happened this habit of finding proxies to do most of the fighting and dying repeated after the s looking for slavic people who could be set up against their neighbours trust the albion once and you are in its fangs forevertodayhistory is repeatingalbion anybody who believes wwww ever ended is already the fool sacrificing himself for the systemic expansion and gain of friendsimagine not knowing what ww and ww was about and getting emotionally triggered every time your ideological standpoint is contested ww and ww was about the destruction of the european balance of power est  and this destruction was carried out by outside ideologues who entered europe trojan horsestyle initially into the uk and france destruction of the reign of monarchy sold to the plebs as an advantage and other countries on the fringes of europe intent on systemic gain they used tools aka proxies to do most of the fighting and dying for them the treaty of versailles was the first attempt to keep germany down in europeanglobal affairs russia out of europeanglobal affairs and the usa in lord ismay europeanglobal affairs it only failed because the usa did
