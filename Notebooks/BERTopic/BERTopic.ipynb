Time and his maturation regarding &quot;banning the realm of vaccinations&quot; on every level is tantamount. You want to know about where the program all started. It began with Polio. It was never a virus. How do I know. Well, I am a Polio survivor who lived his life under that somnambulistic trance for the past 69 years. I was hospitalized when I was 5 in 1955.    <br>          You want to know what Polio is, where it came from, how it did what it did, well why the heck is anyone asking a doctor who never had the challenge, how to treat it? That is absurd. It reminds me of when a male doctor sees a female patient who is pregnant, and the male doctor blurs out that old familiar phrase...&quot;oh I see your pregnant, I know exactly how you feel&quot;. No, you don&#39;t stupid, you&#39;re not a woman and there is no way to pretend you know how a woman &quot;feels&quot; in her female body, how could you. You want to know how Polio feels? Well, why not ask the patient who survived. I have the smoking gun regarding Polio and its origins. I live in that dimension every single day and have done so, for the past 69 long years.<br>        I am 74. You want to know about vaccines, ask me soon as I am getting older. I really need to present my evidence to Elon Musk and Bobby Kennidy with Jack Kruse as well. Last year I woke up to the reality that I was diagnosed with Polio way back then, when I was 5, and the life I have attempted to live, turned into a nightmare, because that life was spent in a stupor of handicap events, that my conscious mind was completely unaware of.

Some may have even succumbed to early and questionable deaths, while others were imprisoned or publicly humiliated and discredited. The corrupt powers and the big money trail use mainstream media to brainwash the public. Exposing the truth is a chronic and dangerous uphill battle.

These insane white clots that look crazy began before the vax. They got worse as time went on, as more and more people caught covid and got the jab. This is why I would like to know the clear data that it‚Äôs the vacinne that has cause these extra million to multiple millions of deaths occurred. How in the actual fuck do you know which is which? I agree the vaccines made things worse more than likely but I‚Äôve yet to hear a doctor like Jack explain that.

No one discussed that here. Jack and Mary are certain it‚Äôs the jab. How do you know all the deaths aren‚Äôt from every person on the globe had been exposed to the virus. The vaccine was rolled out quickly. Of course the mortality rate and cancer rates may have increased as the population of the planet got covid. But where is the data that it‚Äôs all the jab and not the actual virus that was unleashed by the death cult? Both are vile. But no one is talking about the possibility that this lab created virus may be the main reason for all of this. @jackKruse @dannyjones. <br><br>This is a valid question that no one is asking. When I logically try and figure it out I don‚Äôt know. The jab is terrible. I‚Äôll never take another vaccine again in my life of anything. But this problem began with the deep state agenda to kill people and gain control. I wouldn‚Äôt mind if the jab is taken off the market. That would be good. But Cally made a valid point about letting things be available and letting people choose. Jack and Mary claim that almost all of us have zero desire to get the jab. This was an aggressive start from Jack and Mary to insist cally see things exactly like them with the cockiness that we laypeople hate about doctors and the fact that there were no insights as to what is really causing this, the jab or the virus is beyond me. A new kind of blood clot that many embalmers have been observing presented itself before the vaccine and got worse after the vaccine but so did the virus itself continue to infect the global population. Fuck the vaccines. I agree. But please at least acknowledge both unnatural forms of getting the spike protein to spread is worth considering. I work in the funeral industry and I think first we should lock up the people that made this gain of function research a catalyst for all the death. The virus and the jab are man made and you think we are supposed to believe all this sickness is just because of the jab. Not once in this pod was this difference discussed. How do you know what the jab caused and the virus itself is causing once the spike protein gets introduced? Together I‚Äôm sure both are worse but Covid itself caused long covid it seems as well as the jab. Who knows the actual truth. Jack and Mary seem to think the jab is the main cause. It‚Äôs not a good thing to get the jab but with the jab and rising covid both happening at once who knows what the truth is. They are both bad.

No political future for the guy, especially not with MAGA or MAHA. He&#39;s a RINO at best, but not with the balls or required treachery involved. A DemocRat? Yes he&#39;d make a good supplicant DemocRat full of platitudes, dot point narrative.  A weak, low energy, gut-less person who DOES NOT represent MAGA-MAHA in any way. MAGA people will be appalled that he has influence on Trump, the transition team, RFKjr or MAHA. A deep state supplicant. A mealy mouthed social climber, a career lobbyist (liar). How he&#39;s made it this far up the ladder is mystifying, but it seems pretty clear that he has powerful background support from what is (from a MAGA-MAHA perspective) a nefarious and questionable background. Like Obumma had. Glad Kruse was there to counter his pre-planned narrative, and had done some research on him that was telling. Calley wasn&#39;t sure what Kruse would ambush him with next. All he had was a wordy expression of zero that the average MAGA supporter wants to hear. He&#39;s a testosterone free zone. Yes, he talks a lot of crap with little substance. An entitled brat with Ivy school degrees, no brains or any meaningful life experience. Zero. A soy boy. Interesting watching him squirm as he was asked simple questions that he wouldn&#39;t answer. True MAGA people come out and say it out loud, blunt and clear. Backed up with facts, data, evidence or sound experience and spoken forcefully with confidence. This guy&#39;s got nothing.  He&#39;s not MAGA. he&#39;s a mouse. He&#39;s in it for himself. If MAGA people saw this episode they&#39;d be worried. Calley can&#39;t listen to words of experience. He simply doesn&#39;t get what Jack Kruse says. and Kruse has a warm and wonderful way of speaking, with authority. Calley has zero of that. He doesn&#39;t listen to questions, his mind is racing trying to find words to put together an evasive and in his head, believable non-answer. Anyone who can&#39;t answer a straight simple closed question with either a Yes or a No answer cannot be trusted. Period. Trump has to jettison this liability before he has any real influence.

Screaming from the rooftop is morally right but it gets you canceled fast and your mission squashed, unless you&#39;re in the majority, which won&#39;t happen for a while.  <br>Calley believes his approach has a better chance to achieve the goal, considering what we&#39;re facing, and he has a point, however infuriating the circumstances may be. Btw, screaming from the rooftops absolutely needs to continue, as well as trying to reach &amp; educate as many people as possible, so that get the majority. <br>Both Jack &amp; Calley are needed in this battle, and I wish they joined forces and worked out a clever strategy to hit the problem on two flanks.', 'I and my husband do not trust the medical industry.

Psychological ploy to put Jack lower than Calley; childish. That should not have been allowed, and should have been called out and told to not do that again. That was difficult to watch and listen to. And, Calley wondering(?) why Jack gets so angry at him?

At the end of all this there is room for cohesive direction and I just don&#39;t think jack will be an instrument in making progress in the mainstream.

Too good (&amp;fast) to pass the stink test? üôÑ', 'My God, that Calley: Jack, Jack, Jack üôÑ', '&quot;Uncle Jack&quot; is a retarded ape, who ate way too much acid as a kid.  i can&#39;t believe Callie sat through 3 hours of this...', 'Still putting SV40 in kids  !!!!????? That is pure CRIMINAL !!!  That &#39;Sh*T&#39; was in my vaccine when 4 yrs old in southern California.', 'I listened to this on the podcast ‚Ä¶ I 100 percent agree with jack!!!! This other man is very illusive and I can tell he is completely connected to the dark side of this !!! He is afraid to lose the money he is on the take for ‚Ä¶', 'Jack thinks fitbits and CGMs are more harmful than sugar and seed oils. I am not buying it. Ive listened to low carb and fasting podcasts for 11 years. Cutting out sugar and processed food heals people- almost miraculously.', 'Any &quot;medical professional&quot; who believes sexually mutilating, castrating, and sterilizing children is OK is worse than Mengele. The &quot;medical profession&quot; will NEVER recover from having been willing to crawl before the altar of the dangerous transcult and give away their credibility ‚Äì and for what?', 'Here, ill put it put there, of course, if it doesnt get removed. I dont care about this guys mother or these other 2 charlatans opinions..... This isnt just about the üíâ, its also and probably more importantly, about the üçé üçû. Its a combination of &quot;substances&quot; THAT WE THE PEOPLE ARE ALLOWING!! Wake the f up drones. Or just keep &quot;lining up&quot;. That last part meant in so many ways.....', 'Oh my word! I am 1 hr 29 into this. I wish Jack would stop hinting and asking questions and just say what his worry is. Spit it out already. What book did Cally&#39;s dad write? Why does it matter?', 'Dr Jack is just being rude and shutting off my willingness to even give him an inch of credibility.', 'KRUSE MISSLE! Shout out WAR MODE podcast for the recommendation.', 'About 12 years ago, my friend&#39;s dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in Virginia, and he was dead in 2 months.', 'This should have got pushed till about March/April once things get rolling in the new admin... Just saying, might have had new light shined on some of the topics.', 'Jack, people have been getting chronically ill long before the jab. It is ok to write a book about food. The keto / carnivore diet has healed a lot of people.', 'Jack, for the love. You say you have not said the word conspiracy, but you think this guy is part of a conspiracy, and then you pretend like you don&#39;t think there is a conspiracy, but you think there is a conspiracy. Just clearly state your points. CLEARLY.', 'Calley Means is a fraud, clearly.', 'So if a person goes to Stanford or Harvard, you are full of darkness?', 'This is super dumb. Big pharma employs lots of people. Huge corporations hire lots of people. Big corporations have tons of money to rig things in their favor. Duh.', 'Mary has gotten maybe a paragraph in during this discussion and it‚Äôs now two hours in <br><br>Calley dominated the discussion by answering zero questions and saying Jack over and over again. <br><br>Honestly. Calley lost me over this. His entire discussion was a nothing burger.', 'As much as I‚Äôm on jacks side he gives people a bad rep when he can‚Äôt shut up and let the man speak', 'I&#39;m so sick of the means boy using the name Jack, Jack Jack Jack... I am 15 minutes into this interview and I don&#39;t trust the means boy. lol', 'What do you want from me‚Ä¶. I want you to take the data and speak the truth. <br>Why are you being so hard on me‚Ä¶..<br>Because youre the guy that has the platform (and I want to know if we can trust and support you)', 'Jack. Jack. JACKKKKKKKK <br><br><br><br>JACK. jaaaaaaaackkkkkkkk', 'Jihad üòÇ this idiot couldn&#39;t answer a single question from Jack', 'Yes yes yes! True reform is the constitutional amendment and laws to prevent this from happening again. How do you get those done‚Ä¶. Prosecute the crimes committed', 'Jack offered Calley a chance to learn from him. Jack is an alpha man that needs no permission to speak the truth. Calley wasted time getting into a power struggle with Jack. <br>Jack treated Calley the same way he treats everyone else. This is Jack. Calleys insecurity with not controlling the conversation was unfortunate.', 'Did Cally answer any question', 'Here is my observation - he wants to change woo woo consciousness and bring truth energy but he acts like acknowledging a globalist agenda to hide their control of governments and humankind through food, healthcare, wars is a conspiracy. That says everything.', 'Goddamn, so much politicking on one side and bullying on the other, hard to learn anything here', 'Calley Means did not win any fans today.', 'I will unite with anyone to do good, and no one to do harm - Douglass <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXjj2EoElFg&amp;t=71\">1:11</a>', 'I want to know more about you Danny jones? Who do you work for? What deals have you made? Why the all seeing eye? Checkered floor? Who knows what to truely trust besides Christs word. Remember what Dr kruse said where many smart people who attend colleges are brainwashed (MK ULTRA/etc) to push the narrative.', 'calley means is jack kruse and jack kruse is calley means ü§Ø.', 'Jack...jack....jack....jack üòÇ', 'Dont forget the unregulated administration of MRNA into our food (cattle, pork, chicken). Ive heard rumors of GMO lettuce with MRNA from SanDiego University.', 'The more I listen to Jack Cruse the more I just get frustrated with his inability to listen, and his lack of ability to connect with his heart. We all believe in his ideas to some extent, but his bullying and bulldozing approach is offputting to say the least. How he handled addressing Callie‚Äòs mom dying is just uncalled for and I lost a lot of respect for him. It shows his lack of compassion.', 'Jack is a hypocrite it&#39;s clear as the sun in the sky', 'Something slippery about this guy Means. Globalist tendencies to say the least. <br><br>How many times did he say Jack‚Äôs name?', 'This does seem adversarial, but that‚Äôs what‚Äôs missing in hard conversations now days.  Tell a PR man like Calley not to sing and dance around hard questions; they‚Äôre trained to stay in the middle of the road to not alienate people.  <br>More people need to look into Jack, he brings some frightening  revelations about our modern medical society and what it‚Äôs based on and what it came from.  It‚Äôs unsettling in the highest sense.', 'Do a search on ‚ÄúBrighteon University which Mike Adams of Natural News names his collection of doctors who were restricted during the COVID Pandemic. He aims to present truth about the upcoming ‚Äúplsndemuc‚Äôs‚Äù.', 'Seems like Calley is a jew....all about lies and deception', 'Danny is the best host period', 'The woman is just stupid', 'That woman just can&#39;t shut up', 'Calley is so repugnant, it makes my stomach hurt', 'Dr. Kruze&#39;s ridiculous claim Mossad engineered 9/11 doesn&#39;t help his credibility, either']\n"
