    "<u>Contextual Understanding</u>\n",
    "Transformers excel at understanding the context of words within a sentence. They use an \"attention mechanism\" that allows them to weigh the importance of different words in the sentence when determining its meaning. They can effectively capture long-range dependencies between words in a sentence. This means they can understand how words that are far apart in a sentence relate to each other, which is essential for understanding the overall meaning of the sentence. <br>\n",
