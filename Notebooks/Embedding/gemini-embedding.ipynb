          "summary (powered by concisegptConfusionhighlights:- definition of proxy war:  - a proxy war occurs when external parties instrumentalize a conflict, using it as a stand-in for their larger disputes.- advantages for great powers:  - proxy wars offer great powers deniability, allow them to avoid sacrificing their own citizens, and contain violence within another country's borders.- cold war examples:  - the korean war, vietnam war, and the conflict in afghanistan exemplify how the us and the soviet union used proxy wars to fight each other indirectly, spreading their influence and ideologies.- post-cold war shift:  - the end of the cold war did not reduce proxy wars; instead, they increased due to the rise of multiple global powers and the lower cost of supporting proxy forces.- modern proxy wars:  - conflicts in libya, syria, and sudan demonstrate how proxy wars have become longer, deadlier, and more resistant to peace due to multiple patrons supporting different factions.- ukraine as a half-proxy war:  - the conflict in ukraine is described as a \"half proxy war\" because while ukraine is supported by the west against russian aggression, russia itself is deeply engaged and views the conflict as existential.- china's approach:  - china has largely avoided engaging in proxy wars, adhering to a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, although this is being tested in situations like the civil war in myanmar.key insights:- changing nature of warfare:  - direct wars between major powers have become less common due to the threat of nuclear weapons, leading to the rise of proxy wars as the primary means of geopolitical competition.- increased complexity:  - modern proxy wars are more complex than those during the cold war due to the presence of multiple patrons, making conflicts harder to resolve and prolonging the violence.- deadly equilibrium:  - proxy wars often reach a \"dynamic equilibrium\" where external supporters provide just enough assistance to keep the conflict going but not enough to achieve a decisive victory, leading to protracted and devastating wars.- local perspectives:  - while proxy wars are often analyzed from the perspective of great powers, it's crucial to understand the motivations of local groups who may seek external support as a means of survival or to achieve their own objectives.- potential for escalation:  - the conflict in ukraine highlights the risk of escalation in proxy wars, especially when a major power views the outcome as existential, potentially leading to broader and more dangerous confrontations.```",

          "i think strategic historical figures like cardinal richelieu were using proxy wars for a very long time. even caesar. & kublai khan.",
          "funny enough, i had this realization several months ago. actually if you go back to every major civil war, there is always some level of foreign influence or assistance, often by a country or side that is at odds with the country. and also, that every \"independence movement\" is actually very simply a civil war that was successful, and if it wasn't successful, we just refer to it as a civil war, without the romanticization of it being a fight for independence. but i guarantee you that any group that takes up arms against their own country is fighting for their independence and freedom and autonomy, to either separate from the country. there is always the side that fights for the country and its authority and dominance over the smaller group, and that group which wants to break away and have its own autonomy and freedom, and be free from what they see as an oppressive authority that makes laws against them they don't want.  another thing about nation states, there will always be winners and losers within the country, there are those who are subsidized (the recipient of more tax dollars than they payedConfusion and those who are subsidizees (the ones that pay more taxes than they receiveConfusion. for example, in america, there are mining towns in very sparsely populated states like idaho or montana that create insane amounts of wealth in a very small space, a single mining town. however, they are taxed very highly and see alot of that wealth go to the federal government, which then gets sent into cities and urban centers in all shapes and sizes, from low-income housing grants, to investment in infrastructure that only benefits those in cities, to student scholarship grants that only help those going to college. all of these things are payed for by people who will not benefit in any way from those policies. this is what creates and builds resentments inside a country by groups of people towards the central authority/government and becomes the source of a \"civil war\".  groups that feel being taken advantage of, and seeing a government that doesn't equally represent their interests based on their own notions of fairness.  as another example to that effect, there is a growing sentiment in america that the weight of someone's representation in the government should be based on how much you're putting in, like if you're in the class of people paying hundreds of thousands in taxes each year, you should have more representation in the government than a bunch of people who are paying zero dollars in taxes. this is a hotly contested issue ofcourse, but this difference in views about \"fairness\" is really the driving motivation for \"rebellious\" activity that can ultimately lead to \"civil war\" or physical conflict involving many armed skirmishes over weeks, months, years.  this is what the revolutionary war was in american against britain. it is also what the american civil war was, with the south against the north. there still exists sentiments in these highly productive smaller towns, whose labors support the financing and growth of the urban centers, but never see any reward or payoff for such things.  in some very indirect ways, maybe a new technological innovation in an urban center may occasionally offer benefits to these places to improve farming and agriculture practices, productivity, or mining safety, etc.  and this caveat might be the only thing that appeases those resentments, besides the threat of retaliation by the federal government.  but if everyone that payed more taxes than they got back unionized together into a single massive union, and threatened to stop paying their taxes in unison, this would essentially be a declaration of civil war, as it threatens the survival of the country bu threatening the authority of the country, which relies on that tax money to operate.  in any case, the realization that every civil war is also almost always instigated or assisted by a foreign power attempting to undermine the authority of that country, is a big realization. the us for example only broke awake from britain because france wanted to deprive them of the american colonies. it became the battle ground for a war between britain and france that had already been in fierce conflict in the past. this itself was a proxy war for them.  however, then france had its own civil war, so in some ways it could be seen as a group inside france was using american fight for independence as a way to get a foothold in american influence that would then support their own movement for independence, except not to break away from their own country, but to completely displace the current monarchy authority in place of their own selected authority, democracy! and they ended up with napoleon who for a short time adopted the name of king, and they treated him as if royalty.  not to get too off track though, it's important to simply realize there is always bigger forces at play when two smaller forces start fighting. it's an opportunity for the larger forces to find advantages against their rivals. any sort of power struggle or instability is seen as a way to build influence, to support a side, and if they win they become more friendly and favorable to you, and thus you have new allies in high places. the us has done this quite alot in south america and in the middle east. however when you support a side that loses, it really does not bode well for your image and world authority. makes you look bad, like a loser, and the people there will remember and resent you. this is happening in africa towards france, as russia displaces french military presence there and thus their influences there.",

helping for whatever reasons, or whether those who favor and abet the division even know that they are supporting the division: what matters is that division is implemented. for the outside divider with a geographical advantage of distance from violent events, it is not important why the chosen tools choose to work together for the gains of the empire, but the fact that the chosen tools work together to create division and overwhelm a part of the planet somewhere. \"how\" and \"that\" are different premises.the empire is in search of profit, only \"interests\" are important. there are more than enough examples of strategists who openly admit this. the apologists will never address this, since they instinctively realize that they benefit from wars elsewhere. all these \"fence

          "you are all more on the same side than you are willing to see. the distrust that has been bred is very real and legit. transparency and spontaneous, emotional responses breed trust. the difference between straight shooters, and smooth-talkers is apparent here. having been inside the power bases and having to excuse and learn how to communicate in their ways, compromises ones ethics, and ability to be transparent.. i know this because i lived in and spied on them also, while having serious concerns about the longterm damage, agendas, and willful ignorance  that they swim in, and demand anyone inside to play along with.callie may not understand  how being inside those worlds has changed  him into soundy cagey, detached, and good at spinning and dodging...at times  condescending. but it has.while the dr is directly confrontive, and harsh, especially  around the death of callies mother, he is justifiably suspicious  of everything,  because he's lived enough, and experienced  enough, and has special knowledge  that is being hijacked and hidden.all of you have done a good job trying to argue out differences, but the two blind spots are fircing you to go round and round.one side is  being cagey and comfortable  with that \"spin\" way of sharing who he is, (even if it's to use the corrupt system in order to be allowed to continue  being listened toConfusion, who maybe out of lack of life experience,  is unwittingly connected to darker people, and dismissing any concern about those  and the other,  trying to connect dots that may not apply here..may not be deliberate  agendas by anyone to subvert transparency,..because that is going on in nefarious ways by powerful people,  and that is a conscious goal by people  who have done it, are doing it, and hide it.and he is doing it accusingly and  in an intimidating way.i do think that after watching for an hour,  i am bothered by the way callie is so controlled, and presents everything  after filtering through  what he wants us to hear.and that it does breed a feeling of truth-\"lite\" and less transparency...and misdirection.i love that he's gone on record and criticized pharma and food, and is trying to stop them from shortening more lives,  and harming the quality of life for us.that's brave.and definitely  feel the same for both drs here, about scathing criticisms of the cover up and harms by the medical industries and government. i trust them more. not because they are drs. and not because they don't make excuses for corrupt  people  and institutions.it's because they don't seem to have any hidden subtext, or spin to anything  they say. they don't measure and filter,  or distract away from the direct points  or questions like callie does.when you're seeing and responsible for saving lives, and you're old enough to experience  the gravity of that..and living thru  times where you were betrayed and shocked that your government  would lie and do harm...you have no time for spin, or lack of spontaneous  emotional  answers that get to the whole truth, fast.for them all to work together against the same enemies,  these issues will need to be worked thru, if they can be.i hope so.because we need cooperation,  and they mostly have the same (difficultConfusion goals that we have to  work together on, and get action on, to save lives.",
