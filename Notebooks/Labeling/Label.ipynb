    "1. **BERTopic Built-in Labeler**  \n",
    "   - This is the default labeler provided by BERTopic.\n",
    "   - It uses TF-IDF to extract the most informative words within each topic cluster.\n",
    "   - Advantage: Simple, fast, and based on word frequency.\n",
    "   - Limitation: Might prioritize frequent but less meaningful words.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **KeyBERT-based Labeler**  \n",
    "   - Uses the `KeyBERT` library to extract keywords by calculating semantic similarity between words and the overall topic embedding.\n",
    "   - Advantage: Leverages semantic information, can extract less frequent but semantically important keywords.\n",
    "   - Limitation: May produce more specific labels that are harder to generalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Gemini-based Labeler (LLM)**  \n",
    "   - Uses Google's Gemini (Generative AI) to generate keywords by prompting an LLM directly with the topic's documents.\n",
    "   - Advantage: Capable of generating human-like and context-aware labels that may capture abstract concepts.\n",
    "   - Limitation: Computationally expensive and may be influenced by prompt design.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Motivation for Model Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome the limitations of relying on Jaccard Similarity alone, we introduced additional metrics via the `model_metrics()` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Added Metrics:\n",
    "- **Effective Coverage** — how many topics received a sufficient number of keywords.\n",
    "- **Average Label Length** — are the generated labels short and clear or long and verbose?\n",
    "- **Unique Keywords** — how many distinct keywords does the model generate across all topics?\n",

    "1. Better characterize each labeler.\n",
    "2. Identify trends beyond simple keyword overlap.\n",
    "3. Make a more informed decision when selecting a labeler for our task.\n",

      "3. This podcast has to be one of the most spectacular events that ever happened in the world. All three persons and the host reached an epic monumental milestone moment at [158:22] minutes into the show. The fact that Calley was able to gather the grit to stay on with the challenging confrontation before him and have Jack and Mary segue into posturing the Jack Medical Bukele act into our governmental framework leveraging the use of state law, and avoiding the clash of Federal Law, is the best news yet. You arrived at a point where \"we the people\" can help you take action immediately to implement the change that this country and the entire world needs to shift towards. It is doable, practical, and easy to present to the people, who are yearning for a solution to this medical JD Rock-feller, plague of a lifetime, perpetrated through lies and disguise upon humankind. How can we help formulate how we all might address our Governers to usher in this online solution you have arrived at, before our v very eyes, and ears. Superb, stupendous, spectacular.\n",

      "6. Haven’t watched Jack before so can’t speak to his platform. The things he advocates for in a cursory search aren’t wrong. But Calley and Casey advocating for food and pharma improvements aren’t wrong either.Whether you like the way Calley answers or not, I am just as put off by Jack in this particular interview.It came off to me as an “I’m an ego maniac that needs everyone to know I’m a physician and I’m jealous that you and your sister came on scene and sold more books than me this year.”I get the connections Jack has made in Calleys history. But Calley has said upfront that he was a lobbyist. So connections to those elites isn’t a surprise. Either way, no one knows your body like you so do your own research and do not eat or take what is not beneficial to you, the individual.Sad, but until changes are employed, this is what our “healthcare” has become…\n",
      "7. Oh please CalleyI have had my naturopathic medical license since 2007. I would love to speak “from my heart” and let the audience “decide” who is the BEST spokesperson on food and health. How hubris…my sister dropped out of residency and she’s the BEST spokesperson. Let’s bring Dr. Berg into the discussion as well. It would be FUN..\n",

I hope the retired Dr Jack who they brought back like you do with an  old greyhound who's past  prime is aware that NOBODY in the comments have agreed that what he says about Rockefeller and this young man holds water. If he was their doctor and he helped them, they thanked him, and that's it. So I wish this Jack would get off his pedestal of old man wants to beat up young man because he NEVER got to the position that he thought he deserved in life. Jack is straight through BS. . I'm glad he's able to do a thing or two regarding healing people but frankly considering the level of the playing field it's not much.\n",
      "9. I just tried to find Dr Jack Kruse on the web to see what school he is so not famous that he's not on the web &  obviously did not go to Harvard or Stanford or he wouldn't be dissing them. I did find a doctor Jack Kruse who solved his health problem by food and he wrote a whole book on it and created a diet to help Americans change their s*** way of eating so maybe he's jealous of that Jack Kruse  as well as this young man but I'm sick of old men being jealous and either sending out young man to die in war or beating them up in person on the web. I'm glad some of you say Dr Jack helped you but right now he is presenting himself as a Doctor Jekyll Dr Hyde.\n",
      "10. This is ridiculous.Calley & Casey Means walked out of their respective careers because their eyes were opened to the devastating effects of pharma/food on their mother.  THEIR MOTHER. If they were weaker, less intelligent, less driven individuals (clearly inherited/taught - in part- by the same mother) they wouldn't have walked away from the env'ts that caused her chronic disease and death. The timing of their efforts was perfect for gaining awareness & coincided with (likely) the biggest mass-awakening in US history. Tucker then opened the floodgates when he interviewed Calley.People who have been insiders & then had awakenings are exactly the people you should WANT on your side.  They are whistleblowers.Who makes the best doctors? The ones who've woken up to the corruption & limitations of their own training in allopathic medicine, and retrain in functional med. This is EXACTLY what Casey Means is, and Calley is her analog from the PR/marketing world.Jack's incessant unhinged & ludicrously conspiratorial attack just makes him look hysterical.Mary's rage after her treatment at the hands of Houston Methodist and the TX medical board is completely understandable, but pointing fingers at Calley because he happened to have effectively the same awakening as her but has been more successful smacks of envy.\n",
      "11. Lol... It's only 3:40 in and the Janus was called out. Only a \"review\" is being called for??? How many more discussions/ presentations/ research projects need to be produced before the line could be drawn in the sand? Fruit loops is the chosen scapegoat, apparently. I hope R.F. Kennedy, Trump and the rest of their cabinet colleague is watching this video and realising the two-face who is hanging around him. No one is saying there is no institutional pressure, but who dared to say black is black and white is white? Alternatively, what is the possibility that the Means siblings are some kind of triple agents playing the long game?Anyway, please don't forget the millions of other children and adult consumers in the rest of the world who are equally captured by the pharma industry, who are living in countries without the benefit of some health issue debates going on because the \"expert\" opinion based on imported Western science is sacrosanct.\n",
      "12. I don’t understand the sentiment… Dr. J is still trying to fight yesterday‘s Covid battle. I found him as insincere as many apparently think Calley was (what’s worse, a shock jock or a lobbyist?). Dr jack acted like a jerk and you don’t win someone over to your side by talking about their dead mom.\n",
      "13. I think when you put health into the conversation and your personal goal behinds paying off school debt, getting rich. You automatically go to the dark side. I think Dr. Jack and this awesome lady who is a ENT has the perfect approach\n",
      "14. The fiasco that was Covid was all part of the JQ and Jack knows this, but doesn’t come right out and say it, I admire that he sees through the smoke and mirrors.\n",
      "15. This Dr Jack may be knowledgeable but wow us he a JACK-ASS!!Is it any wonder he’s NOT asked to be on decisive policy changing committees of substance for change??Shoot- NONE OF US normal folk (majority of US or World population) knew ANY of these conspiracy things 4 years ago. For these Drs to attack Calley this way proves we will never get ANYWHERE with such an approach. I also think it’s ironic he shows up with a flipping orange Bitcoin Santa hat as a billboard  selling coins. What a shame he’s a Pompous Ass that had he played this conversation differently- he’d likely garnered a seat at the table. Jack may do well to put the chip bag down himself and read the book How To Win Friends and Influence People. Is love to see its resume of work and cohorts to start connecting dots straight to BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard. My point- WE ALL ARE IN THE MATRIX and most of us just starting to truly understand how. I’m still team Calley after this demonstration. Dr Jack Ass will NEVER make any policy board moving fwd. 🤦🏻‍♀️\n",
      "16. This does seem adversarial, but that’s what’s missing in hard conversations now days.  Tell a PR man like Calley not to sing and dance around hard questions; they’re trained to stay in the middle of the road to not alienate people.  More people need to look into Jack, he brings some frightening  revelations about our modern medical society and what it’s based on and what it came from.  It’s unsettling in the highest sense.\n"
