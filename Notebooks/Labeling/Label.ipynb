    "Topic modeling is widely used to discover hidden structures in text datasets. However, labeling the discovered topics is often challenging. Traditional methods generate labels by extracting keywords, which might not always convey the full semantic meaning of the topic.\n",

    "In this project, we aim to:\n",
    "1. Apply BERTopic to cluster YouTube comments into topics.\n",
    "2. Generate labels using:\n",
