    "Topic modeling is widely used to discover hidden structures in text datasets. However, labeling the discovered topics is often challenging. Traditional methods generate labels by extracting keywords, which might not always convey the full semantic meaning of the topic.\n",

    "In this project, we aim to:\n",
    "1. Apply BERTopic to cluster YouTube comments into topics.\n",
    "2. Generate labels using:\n",

Time and his maturation regarding \"banning the realm of vaccinations\" on every level is tantamount. You want to know about where the program all started. It began with Polio. It was never a virus. How do I know. Well, I am a Polio survivor who lived his life under that somnambulistic trance for the past 69 years. I was hospitalized when I was 5 in 1955.              You want to know what Polio is, where it came from, how it did what it did, well why the heck is anyone asking a doctor who never had the challenge, how to treat it? That is absurd. It reminds me of when a male doctor sees a female patient who is pregnant, and the male doctor blurs out that old familiar phrase...\"oh I see your pregnant, I know exactly how you feel\". No, you don\\'t stupid, you\\'re not a woman and there is no way to pretend you know how a woman \"feels\" in her female body, how could you. You want to know how Polio feels? Well, why not ask the patient who survived. I have the smoking gun regarding Polio and its origins. I live in that dimension every single day and have done so, for the past 69 long years.        I am 74. You want to know about vaccines, ask me soon as I am getting older. I really need to present my evidence to Elon Musk and Bobby Kennidy with Jack Kruse as well. Last year I woke up to the reality that I was diagnosed with Polio way back then, when I was 5, and the life I have attempted to live, turned into a nightmare, because that life was spent in a stupor of handicap events, that my conscious mind was completely unaware of.

Think about all of the \"conspiracy theories\" going back decades that activists and journalists have tried to verify, expose, and publicize. How far did they get? Not far. Some may have even succumbed to early and questionable deaths, while others were imprisoned or publicly humiliated and discredited. The corrupt powers and the big money trail use mainstream media to brainwash the public. Exposing the truth is a chronic and dangerous uphill battle. Some times it may seem more safe to play along to get a foot in the door and to then show the bravery of Jack and Mary.  I personally appreciate that Caley and Casey Means have shed light on the corruption of big food and big pharma, as well as helping people to make better health choices.

These insane white clots that look crazy began before the vax. They got worse as time went on, as more and more people caught covid and got the jab. This is why I would like to know the clear data that it’s the vacinne that has cause these extra million to multiple millions of deaths occurred. How in the actual fuck do you know which is which? I agree the vaccines made things worse more than likely but I’ve yet to hear a doctor like Jack explain that. Perhaps he has but this podcast would have been an ideal time to bring that up with the aggressive, mind made up, are you a fraud or stupid attitude.

No one discussed that here. Jack and Mary are certain it’s the jab. How do you know all the deaths aren’t from every person on the globe had been exposed to the virus. The vaccine was rolled out quickly. Of course the mortality rate and cancer rates may have increased as the population of the planet got covid. But where is the data that it’s all the jab and not the actual virus that was unleashed by the death cult? Both are vile. But no one is talking about the possibility that this lab created virus may be the main reason for all of this. @jackKruse @dannyjones. This is a valid question that no one is asking. When I logically try and figure it out I don’t know. The jab is terrible. I’ll never take another vaccine again in my life of anything. But this problem began with the deep state agenda to kill people and gain control. I wouldn’t mind if the jab is taken off the market. That would be good. But Cally made a valid point about letting things be available and letting people choose. Jack and Mary claim that almost all of us have zero desire to get the jab. This was an aggressive start from Jack and Mary to insist cally see things exactly like them with the cockiness that we laypeople hate about doctors and the fact that there were no insights as to what is really causing this, the jab or the virus is beyond me. A new kind of blood clot that many embalmers have been observing presented itself before the vaccine and got worse after the vaccine but so did the virus itself continue to infect the global population. Fuck the vaccines. I agree. But please at least acknowledge both unnatural forms of getting the spike protein to spread is worth considering. I work in the funeral industry and I think first we should lock up the people that made this gain of function research a catalyst for all the death. The virus and the jab are man made and you think we are supposed to believe all this sickness is just because of the jab. Not once in this pod was this difference discussed. How do you know what the jab caused and the virus itself is causing once the spike protein gets introduced? Together I’m sure both are worse but Covid itself caused long covid it seems as well as the jab. Who knows the actual truth. Jack and Mary seem to think the jab is the main cause. It’s not a good thing to get the jab but with the jab and rising covid both happening at once who knows what the truth is. They are both bad.

But it has.While the Dr is directly confrontive, and harsh, especially  around the death of Callies mother, he is justifiably suspicious  of everything,  because he\\'s lived enough, and experienced  enough, and has special knowledge  that is being hijacked and hidden.All of you have done a good job trying to argue out differences, but the two blind spots are fircing you to go round and round.One side is  being cagey and comfortable  with that \"spin\" way of sharing who he is, (even if it\\'s to use the corrupt system in order to be allowed to continue  being listened to), who maybe out of lack of life experience,  is unwittingly connected to darker people, and dismissing any concern about those  And the other,  trying to connect dots that may not apply here..may not be deliberate  agendas by anyone to subvert transparency,..because that IS going on in nefarious ways by powerful people,  and that IS a conscious goal by people  who have done it, are doing it, and hide it.And he is doing it accusingly and  in an intimidating way.I do think that after watching for an hour,  I am bothered by the way Callie is so controlled, and presents everything  after filtering through  what he wants us to hear.And that it does breed a feeling of truth-\"lite\" and less transparency...and misdirection.I love that he\\'s gone on record and criticized pharma and food, and is trying to stop them from shortening more lives,  and harming the quality of life for us.That\\'s brave.And definitely  feel the same for both drs here, about scathing criticisms of the cover up and harms by the medical industries and government. I trust them more. Not because they are drs. And not because they don\\'t make excuses for corrupt  people  and institutions.It\\'s because they don\\'t seem to have any hidden subtext, or spin to anything  they say. They don\\'t measure and filter,  or distract away from the direct points  or questions like Callie does.When you\\'re seeing and responsible for saving lives, and you\\'re old enough to experience  the gravity of that..and living thru  times where you were betrayed and shocked that your government  would lie and do harm...you have no time for spin, or lack of spontaneous  emotional  answers that get to the whole truth, fast.For them all to work together against the same enemies,  these issues will need to be worked thru, if they can be.I hope so.Because we NEED cooperation,  and they mostly have the same (difficult) goals that we HAVE to  work together on, and get action on, to save lives.', 'Calley can’t stop yapping', \"Danny, jack has totally ruined his credibility here for me.

Full data transparency and let the consumer decide.13:20 “that’s not the answer” – Jack that’s not YOUR answer. It’s his. He’s advocating for a more measured strategy, instead of just having a new administration use fiat to shut everything down (as much as I would love that, it’s just not politically realistic) which is what he argues at 18:0021:30 people have meteoric growth in followers all of the time.

Can people not be deep in the industry and then defect? Is this not allowed?37:30 Jack really thinks he’s Columbo by looking at Calley’s public LInkedin profile. Calley keeps acknowledging that the dark places he used to work in are not a secret and a “foundation” to his story. Jack’s like “exactly” (insinuating he’s an op) and Casey’s like “exactly” (insisting he’s a defector). This whole exchange is becoming insufferable.38:05 Calley: “I went to Stanford” Jack: “Darkness”. OK bud, Mary went there too remember.43:00 “the more you talk the bigger hole you dig” – this is how Kafka traps work.44:10 “I don’t think I’m saying anything” – king level gaslighting. This entire discussion is under the premise that Jack thinks the Means are ops.44:26 Mary insinuates that because first time author success is rare, the Means are therefore ops. It’s not that rare. JK Rowling, Harper Lee, Margeret Mitchell, F Scott Fitzgerald, Malcolm Gladwell, Maya Angelou, et al found success in their first works.44:45 Enjoy your BPA lined can of “water”, Jack.45:10 “Word ‘conspiracy’ has only come out of your mouth” – bro, this is why you’re pissing me off. You know what you’re inferring. Stop setting Kafka traps. 47:00 fair concern: is former PR guy still lying for someone? This would be a conspiracy. You are grilling Calley because you think there is a conspiracy. But Calley says the actual word “conspiracy” and it becomes proof of his guilt? Stop being a clown, Jack. I want to ride with you but you’re making it very hard.47:40 “did I get blasted off the internet?” – Jack, you and Mary have already spoken about how difficult it is to get your message out because of the subject matter. You love splitting semantic hairs. You may not have had your accounts “blasted” off the internet, but your content has been severely suppressed, said another way, “blasted off the internet”.49:00 yes we do have a huge problem with trust, don’t we.49:45 Oh Mary went to Stanford? DARKNESS, right Jack?51:40 Mary and Casey have the same training from a DARK university. Who dropped out and who finished? See how easy it is to play this stupid game?52:45 Now Jack is moving into credentialism. You know, “trust the experts”. “Believe science.” “Science knows”. “Casey can’t even see patients like we can”. Jack, you sound like a shitlib. 1:02:00 I’m sorry man, but almost 80% of pancreatic cancer cases are diagnosed at stage 4. How this is some kind of evidence is beyond me.1:04:40 “you’re not a doctor” – more credentialism. “Trust the expert”1:08:18 “you’re not a doctor; I am” – how many times do we have to hear this? I thought we were the side of “do your own research” and “don’t trust the experts”1:08:25 “is it normal to have a stage 4 pancreatic cancer diagnosis?” Yes. It is normal. 80% as previously noted. And as Calley goes on to say. But I’m not a doctor like Jack, so my information is not reliable.1:21:48 No Jack, the “drug dealers” here are the ones who distributed it, the DOD.1:24:20 “getting something done in this generation is about politics” Calley is 100% correct here. Jack and Mary are being completely undisciplined and emotional, and this is why their message will continue to hit walls. They are incapable of coalition building. You simply cannot stick a new administration in and expect them to drop an atom bomb on everything you don’t like. 1:26:20 I’m sorry man, but anyone who doesn’t get 100% on your platform being labeled as an op or a limited hangout or a fabian is just narcissistic and borderline paranoia. So you “agree with everything you said on Rogan” but also, everything you say is a diversion tactic? Which is it?1:28:50 Another Kafka tactic. When someone responds with incredulity at being accused of being a massive wide reaching conspiracy operative, you act like that is further proof of their guilt. “I haven’t laughed at all”. Cool Jack, proud of you?1:37:45 “you’ve not been eloquent at all” I don’t know, he sounds just like every other pod I’ve heard him on. “Ignorance was fair game” no it never was Jack. You know the conclusion you were always going to come to.1:45:20 “two institutions that I hate” One of which is… the one Mary went to, correct?1:45:40 You clearly have no problem confronting people, but you would turn down two of the biggest platforms in the world? But you went on Huberman’s? A Stanford (DARK) professor? Make it make sense, Jack.2:03:45 “Burn it down” You see what happens when “your guy” (Gaetz) gets close? He gets “non-factored”. Maybe the “burn it down” guys isn’t the right tactic.2:08:20 “we need swift accountability” But don’t you first want all the information available and transparent so the people can be informed and on board with your accountability? Isn’t the transparency Calley is advocating for just a step towards mass accountability? Or you just want to send them to Guantanamo before the population has any idea what’s going on and why?2:11:20 Comparing Pearl Harbor to the health crisis is so incredibly stupid. No one demanded “transparency” then before accountability because the transparency was illicit in the attack the moment it happened. It was done by Japan. Conversely, the average civilian has no idea who the perpetrators are in the health crisis because it is so widespread and multifaceted and spread across a half century at least. What a stupid comparison.2:14:20 Jack and Mary are having a heated debate with someone advising the new administration about topics that were untouchable like 2 seconds aga and they’re not optimistic because nobody is passing their purity test. Get a grip. Grow up. Learn how to win small before you win big.2:15:00 “We’re the idiots” this is so immature and pathetic.2:15:53 “you’re a lobbyist” inferring that he’s a fraudster 2:16:20 “I don’t think he’s a fraudster, he’s just ignorant” Which is it?2:19:00 “you’re the guy on tucker and JRE bro” Jack you apparently could have been too, but you turned it down, because uhhhh reasons and purity or something.2:19:05 OK he’s a fraudster again.2:27:50 Again with the purity black pilling. Because the team isn’t 100% our guys, it’s so over. You really expect to have a perfect roster? Christ didn’t even have that. 2:45:00 This is correct. Norms need an easily accessible gateway. We all found had ours at some point along the way. The Means writing an anti vax book would have accomplished absolutely nothing. They would be nobodies.2:46:25 This is correct. Calley should have come in from the top with this counter. Jack is the actual subversive Agent Provocateur here. He should have accused Jack of “Salting” or “Dead Catting” to subvert the MAHA movement just so we could get the immature paranoid Spiderman meme finger pointing out of the way. Instead we’ve wasted 3 hours doing it.2:28:10 This is what I said already. The exact reason they have to bleep it out of the video. Use your brain Jack.At least it ended somewhat OK.', 'Can’t give this one enough likes!', \"One issue I take with jack is his uncontrolled intensity. He's always ready to connect the next dot, maybe even when there's no need to draw a connection between two stand alone issues.

At the end of all this there is room for cohesive direction and I just don't think jack will be an instrument in making progress in the mainstream.

Time and his maturation regarding \"banning the realm of vaccinations\" on every level is tantamount. You want to know about where the program all started. It began with Polio. It was never a virus. How do I know. Well, I am a Polio survivor who lived his life under that somnambulistic trance for the past 69 years. I was hospitalized when I was 5 in 1955. You want to know what Polio is, where it came from, how it did what it did, well why the heck is anyone asking a doctor who never had the challenge, how to treat it? That is absurd. It reminds me of when a male doctor sees a female patient who is pregnant, and the male doctor blurs out that old familiar phrase...\"oh I see your pregnant, I know exactly how you feel\". No, you don\\'t stupid, you\\'re not a woman and there is no way to pretend you know how a woman \"feels\" in her female body, how could you. You want to know how Polio feels? Well, why not ask the patient who survived. I have the smoking gun regarding Polio and its origins. I live in that dimension every single day and have done so, for the past 69 long years. I am 74. You want to know about vaccines, ask me soon as I am getting older. I really need to present my evidence to Elon Musk and Bobby Kennidy with Jack Kruse as well.

These insane white clots that look crazy began before the vax. They got worse as time went on, as more and more people caught covid and got the jab. This is why I would like to know the clear data that it’s the vacinne that has cause these extra million to multiple millions of deaths occurred. How in the actual fuck do you know which is which? I agree the vaccines made things worse more than likely but I’ve yet to hear a doctor like Jack explain that.

No one discussed that here. Jack and Mary are certain it’s the jab. How do you know all the deaths aren’t from every person on the globe had been exposed to the virus. The vaccine was rolled out quickly. Of course the mortality rate and cancer rates may have increased as the population of the planet got covid. But where is the data that it’s all the jab and not the actual virus that was unleashed by the death cult? Both are vile. But no one is talking about the possibility that this lab created virus may be the main reason for all of this. @jackKruse @dannyjones. This is a valid question that no one is asking. When I logically try and figure it out I don’t know. The jab is terrible. I’ll never take another vaccine again in my life of anything. But this problem began with the deep state agenda to kill people and gain control. I wouldn’t mind if the jab is taken off the market. That would be good. But Cally made a valid point about letting things be available and letting people choose. Jack and Mary claim that almost all of us have zero desire to get the jab. This was an aggressive start from Jack and Mary to insist cally see things exactly like them with the cockiness that we laypeople hate about doctors and the fact that there were no insights as to what is really causing this, the jab or the virus is beyond me. A new kind of blood clot that many embalmers have been observing presented itself before the vaccine and got worse after the vaccine but so did the virus itself continue to infect the global population. Fuck the vaccines. I agree. But please at least acknowledge both unnatural forms of getting the spike protein to spread is worth considering. I work in the funeral industry and I think first we should lock up the people that made this gain of function research research a catalyst for all the death. The virus and the jab are man made and you think we are supposed to believe all this sickness is just because of the jab. Not once in this pod was this difference discussed. How do you know what the jab caused and the virus itself is causing once the spike protein gets introduced? Together I’m sure both are worse but Covid itself caused long covid it seems as well as the jab. Who knows the actual truth. Jack and Mary seem to think the jab is the main cause. It’s not a good thing to get the jab but with the jab and rising covid both happening at once who knows what the truth is. They are both bad.

But it has.While the Dr is directly confrontive, and harsh, especially around the death of Callies mother, he is justifiably suspicious of everything, because he\\'s lived enough, and experienced enough, and has special knowledge that is being hijacked and hidden.All of you have done a good job trying to argue out differences, but the two blind spots are fircing you to go round and round.One side is being cagey and comfortable with that \"spin\" way of sharing who he is, (even if it\\'s to use the corrupt system in order to be allowed to continue being listened to), who maybe out of lack of life experience, is unwittingly connected to darker people, and dismissing any concern about those And the other, trying to connect dots that may not apply here..may not be deliberate agendas by anyone to subvert transparency,..because that IS going on in nefarious ways by powerful people, and that IS a conscious goal by people who have done it, are doing it, and hide it.And he is doing it accusingly and in an intimidating way.I do think that after watching for an hour, I am bothered by the way Callie is so controlled, and presents everything after filtering through what he wants us to hear.And that it does breed a feeling of truth-\"lite\" and less transparency...and misdirection.I love that he\\'s gone on record and criticized pharma and food, and is trying to stop them from shortening more lives, and harming the quality of life for us.That\\'s brave.And definitely feel the same for both drs here, about scathing criticisms of the cover up and harms by the medical industries and government. I trust them more. Not because they are drs. And not because they don\\'t make excuses for corrupt people and institutions.It\\'s because they don\\'t seem to have any hidden subtext, or spin to anything they say. They don\\'t measure and filter, or distract away from the direct points or questions like Callie does.When you\\'re seeing and responsible for saving lives, and you\\'re old enough to experience the gravity of that..and living thru times where you were betrayed and shocked that your government would lie and do harm...you have no time for spin, or lack of spontaneous emotional answers that get to the whole truth, fast.For them all to work together against the same enemies, these issues will need to be worked thru, if they can be.I hope so.Because we NEED NEED cooperation, and they mostly have the same (difficult) goals that we HAVE to work together on, and get action on, to save lives.', 'Calley can’t stop stop yapping', \"Danny, jack has totally ruined his credibility here for me.

After hearing this podcast and the first one you did with Uncle Jack, I subscribed to your channel! Thanks for letting this extremely important topic come out. When the jabs came out, even before I studied up on the jab, I heard loudly in my soul! DON\\'T TAKE THIS!! Of course, afterward, I studied with various doctors like Dr. McCullough, etc. I watched the roundtable with Senator Ron Johnson, with doctors, scientists, patients, and representatives of close ones that died!! Among many other studies that included world statistics! I knew when\"covid\" and this jab came out.The world would never be the same! People would tell me that they took the jab and that the description of this jab, ingredients and contraindications weren\\'t on the paper with the box. It was blank!! Who would take that?? To see all of the deaths even in my own small family happen, I couldn\\'t believe this was not taken off the market. I\\'ve heard the CEO of fizer State that they knew this didn\\'t prevent immunity!! I also knew instinctively the game was genocide, genocide, early on!!

I respect moderators who moderate. Rules could be laid out in the beginning, then like a referee, he could shut down the ploy in play. Calley saying Jack's name, especially over and over, when Calley wanted to tamp him down? Psychological ploy to put Jack lower than Calley; childish. That should not have been allowed, and should have been called out and told to not do that again. That was difficult to watch and listen to. And, Calley wondering(?) why Jack gets so angry at him? That deflecting from the topic topic to put the audience's attention on Jack's 'supposed' faults, just shines the light on the obvious deflector's ruse (the ruse that Calley doesn't have much to stand on to convince himself nor the audience). I'm only 32 minutes in, and maybe I can stomach more of this.\", 'Jack is very off off putting.', \"There isn't a sense of optimism, there is fear that T will be a dictator who sells off the United States to the highest bidder, puts nut nut jobs in his cabinet, and lines his own pockets. Those thinking T is great is ignoring facts and reality.\", 'The only thing worse than Calley’s smarmy tongue and untrustworthy physiognomy is Jack’s narcissistic and paranoid-shizo ranting and gaslighting. This whole thing is a train wreck and unwatchable. But I did anyway.2:52 \"I don\\'t think they\\'re personal attacks\" – yeah Jack, questioning the authenticity of their mother\\'s death would be considered personal.3:35 \"why isn\\'t the word vakseen in your book once\" – the word \"pharma\" is 16 times. did you notice that Danny didn\\'t need to censor the word \"pharma\" on this youtube video? but he did censor \"vakseen\"? perhaps being a little more strategic about extremely third rail hotwords in their book was intentional.11:10 “should the shots be pulled off the market” – he’s policy stance is basically libertarian. Full data transparency and let the consumer decide.13:20 “that’s not the answer” – Jack that’s not YOUR answer. It’s his. He’s advocating for a more measured strategy, instead of just having a new administration use fiat to shut everything down (as much as I would love that, it’s just not politically realistic) which is what he argues at 18:0021:30 people have meteoric growth in followers all of the time. They were on two of the biggest podcasts in the world. How is this sus?21:50 “maybe you can tell us your secret” – yeah the secret is to be a little more subtle and maybe don’t excessively use the words that get you regularly suppressed29:30 Hey Jack, maybe not everyone knows about everything you just got done saying, and maybe attacking someone who wants it to have “maximum airtime” and “sunlight” is counterintuitive.30:40 Is anyone who happened to intern at a suspect company while they were in college beyond redemption? Can people not be deep in the industry and then defect? Is this not allowed?37:30 Jack really thinks he’s Columbo by looking at Calley’s public LInkedin profile. Calley keeps acknowledging that the dark places he used to work in are not a secret and a “foundation” to his story. Jack’s like “exactly” (insinuating he’s an op) and Casey’s like “exactly” (insisting he’s a defector). This whole exchange is becoming insufferable.38:05 Calley: “I went to Stanford” Jack: “Darkness”. OK bud, Mary went there too remember.43:00 “the more you talk the bigger hole you dig” – this is how Kafka traps work.44:10 “I don’t think I’m saying anything” – king level gaslighting. This entire discussion is under the premise that Jack thinks the Means are ops.44:26 Mary insinuates that because first time author success is rare, the Means are therefore ops. It’s not that rare. JK Rowling, Harper Lee, Margeret Mitchell, F Scott Fitzgerald, Malcolm Gladwell, Maya Angelou, et al found success in their first works.44:45 Enjoy your BPA lined can of “water”, Jack.45:10 “Word ‘conspiracy’ has only come out of your mouth” – bro, this is why you’re pissing me off. You know what you’re inferring. Stop setting Kafka traps. 47:00 fair concern: is former PR guy still lying for someone? This would be a conspiracy. You are grilling Calley because you think there is a conspiracy. But Calley says the actual word “conspiracy” and it becomes proof of his guilt? Stop being a clown, Jack. I want to ride with you but you’re making it very hard.47:40 “did I get blasted off the internet?” – Jack, you and Mary have already spoken about how difficult it is to get your message out because of the subject matter. You love splitting semantic hairs. You may not have had your accounts “blasted” off the internet, but your content has been severely suppressed, said another way, “blasted off the internet”.49:00 yes we do have a huge problem with trust, don’t we.49:45 Oh Mary went to Stanford? DARKNESS, right Jack?51:40 Mary and Casey have the same training from a DARK university. Who dropped out and who finished? See how easy it is to play this stupid game?52:45 Now Jack is moving into credentialism. You know, “trust the experts”. “Believe science.” “Science knows”. “Casey can’t even see patients like we can”. Jack, you sound like a shitlib. 1:02:00 I’m sorry man, but almost 80% of pancreatic cancer cases are diagnosed at stage 4. How this is some kind of evidence is beyond me.1:04:40 “you’re not a doctor” – more credentialism. “Trust the expert”1:08:18 “you’re not a doctor; I am” – how many times do we have to hear this? I thought we were the side of “do your own research” and “don’t trust the experts”1:08:25 “is it normal to have a stage 4 pancreatic cancer diagnosis?” Yes. It is normal. 80% as previously noted. And as Calley goes on to say. But I’m not a doctor like Jack, so my information is not reliable.1:21:48 No Jack, the “drug dealers” here are the ones who distributed it, the DOD.1:24:20 “getting something done in this generation is about politics” Calley is 100% correct here. Jack and Mary are being completely undisciplined and emotional, and this is why their message will continue to hit walls. They are incapable of coalition building. You simply cannot stick a new administration in and expect them to drop an atom bomb on everything you don’t like. 1:26:20 I’m sorry man, but anyone who doesn’t get 100% on your platform being labeled as an op or a limited hangout or a fabian is just narcissistic and borderline paranoia. So you “agree with everything you said on Rogan” but also, everything you say is a diversion tactic? Which is it?1:28:50 Another Kafka tactic. When someone responds with incredulity at being accused of being a massive wide reaching conspiracy operative, you act like that is further proof of their guilt. “I haven’t laughed at all”. Cool Jack, proud of you?1:37:45 “you’ve not been eloquent at all” I don’t know, he sounds just like every other pod I’ve heard him on. “Ignorance was fair game” no it never was Jack. You know the conclusion you were always always going to come to.1:45:20 “two institutions that I hate” One of which is… the one Mary went to, correct?1:45:40 You clearly have no problem confronting people, but you would turn down two of the biggest platforms in the world? But you went on Huberman’s? A Stanford (DARK) professor? Make it make sense, Jack.2:03:45 “Burn it down” You see what happens when “your guy” (Gaetz) gets close? He gets “non-factored”. Maybe the “burn it down” guys isn’t the right tactic.2:08:20 “we need swift accountability” But don’t you first want all the information available and transparent so the people can be informed and on board with your accountability? Isn’t the transparency Calley is advocating for just a step towards mass accountability? Or you just want to send them to Guantanamo before the population has any idea what’s going on and why?2:11:20 Comparing Pearl Harbor to the health crisis is so incredibly stupid. No one demanded “transparency” then before accountability because the transparency was illicit in the attack the moment it happened. It was done by Japan. Conversely, the average civilian has no idea who the perpetrators are in the health crisis because it is so widespread and multifaceted and spread across a half century at least. What a stupid comparison.2:14:20 Jack and Mary are having a heated debate with someone advising the new administration about topics that were untouchable like 2 seconds aga and they’re not optimistic because nobody is passing their purity test. Get a grip. Grow up. Learn how to win small before you win big.2:15:00 “We’re the idiots” this is so immature and pathetic.2:15:53 “you’re a lobbyist” inferring that he’s a fraudster 2:16:20 “I don’t think he’s a fraudster, he’s just ignorant” Which is it?2:19:00 “you’re the guy on tucker and JRE bro” Jack you apparently could have been too, but you turned it down, because uhhhh reasons and purity or something.2:19:05 OK he’s a fraudster again.2:27:50 Again with the purity black pilling. Because the team isn’t 100% our guys, it’s so over. You really expect to have a perfect roster? Christ didn’t even have that. 2:45:00 This is correct. Norms need an easily accessible gateway. We all found had ours at some point along the way. The Means writing an anti vax book would have accomplished absolutely nothing. They would be nobodies.2:46:25 This is correct. Calley should have come in from the top with this counter. Jack is the actual subversive Agent Provocateur here. He should have accused Jack of “Salting” or “Dead Catting” to subvert the MAHA movement just so we could get the immature paranoid Spiderman meme finger pointing out of the way. Instead we’ve wasted 3 hours doing it.2:28:10 This is what I said already. The exact reason they have to bleep it out of the video. Use your brain Jack.At least it ended somewhat OK.', 'Can’t give give this one enough likes!', \"One issue I take with jack is is his uncontrolled intensity. He's always ready to connect the next dot, maybe even when there's no need to draw a connection between two stand alone issues.

It's hard to watch with accusations such as the guy's dad's book and a few other points similar to. At the end of all this there is room for cohesive direction and I just don't think jack will be an instrument in making progress in the mainstream.
