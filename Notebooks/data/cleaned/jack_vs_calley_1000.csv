A huge number of people still buy into the covid narrative and response measures. These are the people who need to be convinced, and it won't happen through someone like Jack.

He's making accusations with circumstantial evidence. Everyone should be skeptical, but being skeptical also means being open-minded. Jack does not come across this way and at many times seems very narrow-minded. Regardless of whether Jack is entirely right, he needs to be able to reach people in a more effective way. One of his big points of suspicion is, ""Well why haven't I gotten as much attention as Calley?"" From my perspective it's because he comes across in a very unpleasant and condescending way.

"This is a great podcast. Dr. Mary has been through hell and back, in her practice so she represents a clear litmus test for evaluating anyone on the scene about ""jabs"". Jack is a tribe leader and going to ""vet"" anyone on quite a few subjects. I know for a fact that I was MKUltra'd in school and as a kid with the world of television and music. Almost anyone in the working system of any schooling is a product of JD Rockefeller's programing. In a sense people and families who lived through Disney's effect on the world has been ""waterboarded"" and is thoroughly ""Spellbound"". Since getting a heck of a lot more sunshine in my life, I am getting clearer instructions for regaining my health. And the best way to ""come out of this trance from the elites"", Sun is the only antidote.            It runs so deep that anyone, even Calley Means is unable to see how he fits the mold to a tee. Time and his maturation regarding ""banning the realm of vaccinations"" on every level is tantamount. You want to know about where the program all started. It began with Polio. It was never a virus. How do I know. Well, I am a Polio survivor who lived his life under that somnambulistic trance for the past 69 years. I was hospitalized when I was 5 in 1955.              You want to know what Polio is, where it came from, how it did what it did, well why the heck is anyone asking a doctor who never had the challenge, how to treat it? That is absurd. It reminds me of when a male doctor sees a female patient who is pregnant, and the male doctor blurs out that old familiar phrase...""oh I see your pregnant, I know exactly how you feel"". No, you don't stupid, you're not a woman and there is no way to pretend you know how a woman ""feels"" in her female body, how could you. You want to know how Polio feels? Well, why not ask the patient who survived. I have the smoking gun regarding Polio and its origins. I live in that dimension every single day and have done so, for the past 69 long years.        I am 74. You want to know about vaccines, ask me soon as I am getting older. I really need to present my evidence to Elon Musk and Bobby Kennidy with Jack Kruse as well. Last year I woke up to the reality that I was diagnosed with Polio way back then, when I was 5, and the life I have attempted to live, turned into a nightmare, because that life was spent in a stupor of handicap events, that my conscious mind was completely unaware of. I guess you could say, ""you had to be there, in my shoes to experience it, in order to believe it"".",@michaelmoreau2590,1,0,this is a great podcast dr mary has been through hell and back in her practice so she represents a clear litmus test for evaluating anyone on the scene about jabs jack is a tribe leader and going to vet anyone on quite a few subjects i know for a fact that i was mkultrad in school and as a kid with the world of television and music almost anyone in the working system of any schooling is a product of jd rockefellers programing in a sense people and families who lived through disneys effect on the world has been waterboarded and is thoroughly spellbound since getting a heck of a lot more sunshine in my life i am getting clearer instructions for regaining my health and the best way to come out of this trance from the elites sun is the only antidote            it runs so deep that anyone even calley means is unable to see how he fits the mold to a tee time and his maturation regarding banning the realm of vaccinations on every level is tantamount you want to know about where the program all started it began with polio it was never a virus how do i know well i am a polio survivor who lived his life under that somnambulistic trance for the past  years i was hospitalized when i was  in               you want to know what polio is where it came from how it did what it did well why the heck is anyone asking a doctor who never had the challenge how to treat it that is absurd it reminds me of when a male doctor sees a female patient who is pregnant and the male doctor blurs out that old familiar phraseoh i see your pregnant i know exactly how you feel no you dont stupid youre not a woman and there is no way to pretend you know how a woman feels in her female body how could you you want to know how polio feels well why not ask the patient who survived i have the smoking gun regarding polio and its origins i live in that dimension every single day and have done so for the past  long years        i am  you want to know about vaccines ask me soon as i am getting older i really need to present my evidence to elon musk and bobby kennidy with jack kruse as well last year i woke up to the reality that i was diagnosed with polio way back then when i was  and the life i have attempted to live turned into a nightmare because that life was spent in a stupor of handicap events that my conscious mind was completely unaware of i guess you could say you had to be there in my shoes to experience it in order to believe it

"You are all more on the same side than you are willing to see. The distrust that has been bred is very real and legit. Transparency and SPONTANEOUS, emotional responses breed trust. The difference between straight shooters, and smooth-talkers is apparent here. Having been inside the power bases and having to excuse and learn how to communicate in their ways, compromises ones ethics, and ability to be transparent.. I know this because I lived in and spied on them also, while having serious concerns about the longterm damage, agendas, and willful ignorance  that they swim in, and demand anyone inside to play along with.Callie may not understand  how being inside those worlds has changed  him into soundy cagey, detached, and good at spinning and dodging...at times  condescending. But it has.While the Dr is directly confrontive, and harsh, especially  around the death of Callies mother, he is justifiably suspicious  of everything,  because he's lived enough, and experienced  enough, and has special knowledge  that is being hijacked and hidden.All of you have done a good job trying to argue out differences, but the two blind spots are fircing you to go round and round.One side is  being cagey and comfortable  with that ""spin"" way of sharing who he is, (even if it's to use the corrupt system in order to be allowed to continue  being listened to), who maybe out of lack of life experience,  is unwittingly connected to darker people, and dismissing any concern about those  And the other,  trying to connect dots that may not apply here..may not be deliberate  agendas by anyone to subvert transparency,..because that IS going on in nefarious ways by powerful people,  and that IS a conscious goal by people  who have done it, are doing it, and hide it.And he is doing it accusingly and  in an intimidating way.I do think that after watching for an hour,  I am bothered by the way Callie is so controlled, and presents everything  after filtering through  what he wants us to hear.And that it does breed a feeling of truth-""lite"" and less transparency...and misdirection.I love that he's gone on record and criticized pharma and food, and is trying to stop them from shortening more lives,  and harming the quality of life for us.That's brave.And definitely  feel the same for both drs here, about scathing criticisms of the cover up and harms by the medical industries and government.

A laborious, torturous 3 hrs of a wimpy, winey, wishy-washy, apologist for the people who've put up with him to achieve their political ends. A product of MKULTRA but doesn't know it. No political future for the guy, especially not with MAGA or MAHA. He's a RINO at best, but not with the balls or required treachery involved. A DemocRat? Yes he'd make a good supplicant DemocRat full of platitudes, dot point narrative.  A weak, low energy, gut-less person who DOES NOT represent MAGA-MAHA in any way. MAGA people will be appalled that he has influence on Trump, the transition team, RFKjr or MAHA. A deep state supplicant. A mealy mouthed social climber, a career lobbyist (liar). How he's made it this far up the ladder is mystifying, but it seems pretty clear that he has powerful background support from what is (from a MAGA-MAHA perspective) a nefarious and questionable background. Like Obumma had. Glad Kruse was there to counter his pre-planned narrative, and had done some research on him that was telling. Calley wasn't sure what Kruse would ambush him with next. All he had was a wordy expression of zero that the average MAGA supporter wants to hear. He's a testosterone free zone. Yes, he talks a lot of crap with little substance. An entitled brat with Ivy school degrees, no brains or any meaningful life experience. Zero. A soy boy. Interesting watching him squirm as he was asked simple questions that he wouldn't answer. True MAGA people come out and say it out loud, blunt and clear. Backed up with facts, data, evidence or sound experience and spoken forcefully with confidence. This guy's got nothing.  He's not MAGA. he's a mouse. He's in it for himself. If MAGA people saw this episode they'd be worried. Calley can't listen to words of experience. He simply doesn't get what Jack Kruse says. and Kruse has a warm and wonderful way of speaking, with authority. Calley has zero of that. He doesn't listen to questions, his mind is racing trying to find words to put together an evasive and in his head, believable non-answer.

Among many other studies that included world statistics!   I knew when""covid"" and  this jab came out.The world would never be the same! People would tell me that they took the jab and that the description of this jab, ingredients  and contraindications weren't on the paper with the box. It was blank!! Who would take that?? To see all of the deaths even in my own small family happen, I couldn't believe this was not taken off the market. I've heard the CEO of fizer State that they knew this didn't prevent immunity!! I also  knew instinctively the game was genocide, early on!!   Uncle Jack, I  remember the day that I realized that our government has been lying to us all along!
