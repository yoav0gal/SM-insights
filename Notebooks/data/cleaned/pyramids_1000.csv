"This would be pre-Egyptian. Note the Egyptian Sphinx is relatively high, up toward what would be the peak of the pyramid. That is the Egyptian part much, much later.  Look, if this is real, as a Bible guy with a Master in Theology, this does not rock my world, nor is it surprising. Though folks often will catalog it as ""woo-woo"" stuff, fallen angel (read ""demonic"") hybrid stuff before the flood is in Genesis 6, with other connecting passages littered here and there throughout the scriptures, all the way into the New Testament. In fact, not a few understand this hybridism that also produced giants is one primary reason God stepped in to wipe out all but Noah and family, according to the Bible. Flood waters and moving silt are how we get rock layers in a matter of a few months and also fossils, just like at Mount Saint Helens in Washington that only blew in 1980. This is how you get fossilized buildings as the earth's mantle shifts under weight of water and mud, thrusting mountain ranges upward, settling into vast canyons vacated when the waters thrust upward in the flood. That the Giza plateau  would then be covered in silt and sand after a flood is not surprising. We see micro-versions of this activity today, each flood season. So if you have some highly intelligent giant hybrid human/angel race now by word-of-mouth in the lore of many cultures, the demi-gods, etc. such beings could have built many things, tall buildings, high steps, vast complexes... that were either wiped out in the flood, or covered over.
