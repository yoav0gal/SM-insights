"I can understand that jack and mary feel very strongly about their positions, and rightfully so, but their attitude (mostly jacks) is frankly overly aggressive and off putting. A huge number of people still buy into the covid narrative and response measures. These are the people who need to be convinced, and it won't happen through someone like Jack. Imo, if he actually cares about his message, he should be more tactful. Is Calley some WEF globalist agenda shill? I don't know, but neither does Jack. He's making accusations with circumstantial evidence. Everyone should be skeptical, but being skeptical also means being open-minded. Jack does not come across this way and at many times seems very narrow-minded. Regardless of whether Jack is entirely right, he needs to be able to reach people in a more effective way. One of his big points of suspicion is, ""Well why haven't I gotten as much attention as Calley?"" From my perspective it's because he comes across in a very unpleasant and condescending way. He is shooting himself in the foot by carrying himself in this fashion and won't get very far with spreading his message.",@darienkinne1347,1,0

Well one's influence is solely MONEY... especially when it comes to big pharma.  Lobbyists become lobbyists because MONEY and lies are their game. So I would trust the brain surgeon before I EVER trust anything a lobbyists says. Lobbyists (professionals in the field of BRIBERY) have split tongues.... and they are loyal to the money that pays them... period.  Sounds like he is trying to deflect and redirect blame toward medications (not jabs) and the food system.  You can tell he is kikely being paid to be projab.... but won't let his own kids get those shots.   When someone won't say yes or no.... there is a reason.

"Man... I'm only 1/3 of the way through this and it's hard to listen to. I commend Calley for coming on to the podcast, so far it's tough to hear him seemingly skirting important issues. I'm not really familiar yet with him or his sister, though I know they're suddenly everywhere and my wife read their book. Why he won't even give a clear answer on why he doesn't feel the ""you know whats"" should be immediately banned is very troubling. Dr Jack Kruse is extremely impressive.

"This is a great podcast. Dr. Mary has been through hell and back, in her practice so she represents a clear litmus test for evaluating anyone on the scene about ""jabs"". Jack is a tribe leader and going to ""vet"" anyone on quite a few subjects. I know for a fact that I was MKUltra'd in school and as a kid with the world of television and music. Almost anyone in the working system of any schooling is a product of JD Rockefeller's programing. In a sense people and families who lived through Disney's effect on the world has been ""waterboarded"" and is thoroughly ""Spellbound"". Since getting a heck of a lot more sunshine in my life, I am getting clearer instructions for regaining my health. And the best way to ""come out of this trance from the elites"", Sun is the only antidote.            It runs so deep that anyone, even Calley Means is unable to see how he fits the mold to a tee. Time and his maturation regarding ""banning the realm of vaccinations"" on every level is tantamount. You want to know about where the program all started. It began with Polio. It was never a virus. How do I know. Well, I am a Polio survivor who lived his life under that somnambulistic trance for the past 69 years. I was hospitalized when I was 5 in 1955.              You want to know what Polio is, where it came from, how it did what it did, well why the heck is anyone asking a doctor who never had the challenge, how to treat it? That is absurd. It reminds me of when a male doctor sees a female patient who is pregnant, and the male doctor blurs out that old familiar phrase...""oh I see your pregnant, I know exactly how you feel"". No, you don't stupid, you're not a woman and there is no way to pretend you know how a woman ""feels"" in her female body, how could you. You want to know how Polio feels? Well, why not ask the patient who survived. I have the smoking gun regarding Polio and its origins. I live in that dimension every single day and have done so, for the past 69 long years.        I am 74. You want to know about vaccines, ask me soon as I am getting older. I really need to present my evidence to Elon Musk and Bobby Kennidy with Jack Kruse as well. Last year I woke up to the reality that I was diagnosed with Polio way back then, when I was 5, and the life I have attempted to live, turned into a nightmare, because that life was spent in a stupor of handicap events, that my conscious mind was completely unaware of. I guess you could say, ""you had to be there, in my shoes to experience it, in order to believe it"".",@michaelmoreau2590,1,0

"i have read many of the comments and I do not necessarily disagree with them, but I would like to offer a potential alternative consideration. Think about all of the ""conspiracy theories"" going back decades that activists and journalists have tried to verify, expose, and publicize. How far did they get? Not far. Some may have even succumbed to early and questionable deaths, while others were imprisoned or publicly humiliated and discredited. The corrupt powers and the big money trail use mainstream media to brainwash the public. Exposing the truth is a chronic and dangerous uphill battle. Some times it may seem more safe to play along to get a foot in the door and to then show the bravery of Jack and Mary.  I personally appreciate that Caley and Casey Means have shed light on the corruption of big food and big pharma, as well as helping people to make better health choices.

"Like, provide the data that of the vaccines had never happened that all the same health issues wouldn‚Äôt have occurred. Thats what I want to know. These insane white clots that look crazy began before the vax. They got worse as time went on, as more and more people caught covid and got the jab. This is why I would like to know the clear data that it‚Äôs the vacinne that has cause these extra million to multiple millions of deaths occurred. How in the actual fuck do you know which is which? I agree the vaccines made things worse more than likely but I‚Äôve yet to hear a doctor like Jack explain that. Perhaps he has but this podcast would have been an ideal time to bring that up with the aggressive, mind made up, are you a fraud or stupid attitude.

"How do we know a gain of function virus is not the cause of all the deaths instead of the jab. No one discussed that here. Jack and Mary are certain it‚Äôs the jab. How do you know all the deaths aren‚Äôt from every person on the globe had been exposed to the virus. The vaccine was rolled out quickly. Of course the mortality rate and cancer rates may have increased as the population of the planet got covid. But where is the data that it‚Äôs all the jab and not the actual virus that was unleashed by the death cult? Both are vile. But no one is talking about the possibility that this lab created virus may be the main reason for all of this. @jackKruse @dannyjones. This is a valid question that no one is asking. When I logically try and figure it out I don‚Äôt know. The jab is terrible. I‚Äôll never take another vaccine again in my life of anything. But this problem began with the deep state agenda to kill people and gain control. I wouldn‚Äôt mind if the jab is taken off the market. That would be good. But Cally made a valid point about letting things be available and letting people choose. Jack and Mary claim that almost all of us have zero desire to get the jab. This was an aggressive start from Jack and Mary to insist cally see things exactly like them with the cockiness that we laypeople hate about doctors and the fact that there were no insights as to what is really causing this, the jab or the virus is beyond me. A new kind of blood clot that many embalmers have been observing presented itself before the vaccine and got worse after the vaccine but so did the virus itself continue to infect the global population. Fuck the vaccines. I agree. But please at least acknowledge both unnatural forms of getting the spike protein to spread is worth considering. I work in the funeral industry and I think first we should lock up the people that made this gain of function research a catalyst for all the death. The virus and the jab are man made and you think we are supposed to believe all this sickness is just because of the jab. Not once in this pod was this difference discussed. How do you know what the jab caused and the virus itself is causing once the spike protein gets introduced? Together I‚Äôm sure both are worse but Covid itself caused long covid it seems as well as the jab. Who knows the actual truth. Jack and Mary seem to think the jab is the main cause. It‚Äôs not a good thing to get the jab but with the jab and rising covid both happening at once who knows what the truth is. They are both bad.

"You are all more on the same side than you are willing to see. The distrust that has been bred is very real and legit. Transparency and SPONTANEOUS, emotional responses breed trust. The difference between straight shooters, and smooth-talkers is apparent here. Having been inside the power bases and having to excuse and learn how to communicate in their ways, compromises ones ethics, and ability to be transparent.. I know this because I lived in and spied on them also, while having serious concerns about the longterm damage, agendas, and willful ignorance  that they swim in, and demand anyone inside to play along with.Callie may not understand  how being inside those worlds has changed  him into soundy cagey, detached, and good at spinning and dodging...at times  condescending. But it has.While the Dr is directly confrontive, and harsh, especially  around the death of Callies mother, he is justifiably suspicious  of everything,  because he's lived enough, and experienced  enough, and has special knowledge  that is being hijacked and hidden.All of you have done a good job trying to argue out differences, but the two blind spots are fircing you to go round and round.One side is  being cagey and comfortable  with that ""spin"" way of sharing who he is, (even if it's to use the corrupt system in order to be allowed to continue  being listened to), who maybe out of lack of life experience,  is unwittingly connected to darker people, and dismissing any concern about those  And the other,  trying to connect dots that may not apply here..may not be deliberate  agendas by anyone to subvert transparency,..because that IS going on in nefarious ways by powerful people,  and that IS a conscious goal by people  who have done it, are doing it, and hide it.And he is doing it accusingly and  in an intimidating way.I do think that after watching for an hour,  I am bothered by the way Callie is so controlled, and presents everything  after filtering through  what he wants us to hear.And that it does breed a feeling of truth-""lite"" and less transparency...and misdirection.I love that he's gone on record and criticized pharma and food, and is trying to stop them from shortening more lives,  and harming the quality of life for us.That's brave.And definitely  feel the same for both drs here, about scathing criticisms of the cover up and harms by the medical industries and government. I trust them more. Not because they are drs. And not because they don't make excuses for corrupt  people  and institutions.It's because they don't seem to have any hidden subtext, or spin to anything  they say. They don't measure and filter,  or distract away from the direct points  or questions like Callie does.When you're seeing and responsible for saving lives, and you're old enough to experience  the gravity of that..and living thru  times where you were betrayed and shocked that your government  would lie and do harm...you have no time for spin, or lack of spontaneous  emotional  answers that get to the whole truth, fast.For them all to work together against the same enemies,  these issues will need to be worked thru, if they can be.I hope so.Because we NEED cooperation,  and they mostly have the same (difficult) goals that we HAVE to  work together on, and get action on, to save lives.",@juliaschlegel7175,0,0

For Dr Mary to blame the lack of trust on non-medical person AKA Kelly on a person who they acknowledged has actually no medical degree and does not practice as a doctor a k e Casey is heating the true situation which is that we do not trust her or Jack because they are doctors.

If they were weaker, less intelligent, less driven individuals (clearly inherited/taught - in part- by the same mother) they wouldn't have walked away from the env'ts that caused her chronic disease and death. The timing of their efforts was perfect for gaining awareness & coincided with (likely) the biggest mass-awakening in US history. Tucker then opened the floodgates when he interviewed Calley.People who have been insiders & then had awakenings are exactly the people you should WANT on your side.  They are whistleblowers.Who makes the best doctors? The ones who've woken up to the corruption & limitations of their own training in allopathic medicine, and retrain in functional med. This is EXACTLY what Casey Means is, and Calley is her analog from the PR/marketing world.Jack's incessant unhinged & ludicrously conspiratorial attack just makes him look hysterical.Mary's rage after her treatment at the hands of Houston Methodist and the TX medical board is completely understandable, but pointing fingers at Calley because he happened to have effectively the same awakening as her but has been more successful smacks of envy.",@carolann2930,1,0

Dr jack has the veil threat when he talks about Casey and the fact she does not have a medical license and he doesn't say the silent part which is that she's practicing medicine and he doesn't say it because she's not practicing medicine she never said that eating an egg instead of fruit loops would cure you of anything I've been through this a million times because I belong to alternative health entities decades before Dr Jack ever got on this mRNA bandwagon which she's ready to hell and back. You can't say it cures but you can say it makes you feel better etcetera etcetera. The veil threat shows that guy is evil and I'm glad if he's helping people medically speaking because evil always as he can tell you right now surrounds itself with good and that's what he's trying to say that Kelly who is a very naive young man is doing but I can see he's not doing that he's not as clever as evil Jack because when you make a an agreement with the devil he gives you he does give you certain high-level means to function and to achieve your goal and it's very sad that Dr Jack is a doctor because he has his evil streak which is so obvious if you've ever been around evil you know it.,@LadyBug1967,1,0

As for who's attacking the food problem in the administration I'm not quite sure unless Bobby is able to delegate that and maybe he'll bring on Calley and Casey Means to spearhead that.

No political future for the guy, especially not with MAGA or MAHA. He's a RINO at best, but not with the balls or required treachery involved. A DemocRat? Yes he'd make a good supplicant DemocRat full of platitudes, dot point narrative.  A weak, low energy, gut-less person who DOES NOT represent MAGA-MAHA in any way. MAGA people will be appalled that he has influence on Trump, the transition team, RFKjr or MAHA. A deep state supplicant. A mealy mouthed social climber, a career lobbyist (liar). How he's made it this far up the ladder is mystifying, but it seems pretty clear that he has powerful background support from what is (from a MAGA-MAHA perspective) a nefarious and questionable background. Like Obumma had. Glad Kruse was there to counter his pre-planned narrative, and had done some research on him that was telling. Calley wasn't sure what Kruse would ambush him with next. All he had was a wordy expression of zero that the average MAGA supporter wants to hear. He's a testosterone free zone. Yes, he talks a lot of crap with little substance. An entitled brat with Ivy school degrees, no brains or any meaningful life experience. Zero. A soy boy. Interesting watching him squirm as he was asked simple questions that he wouldn't answer. True MAGA people come out and say it out loud, blunt and clear. Backed up with facts, data, evidence or sound experience and spoken forcefully with confidence. This guy's got nothing.  He's not MAGA. he's a mouse. He's in it for himself. If MAGA people saw this episode they'd be worried. Calley can't listen to words of experience. He simply doesn't get what Jack Kruse says. and Kruse has a warm and wonderful way of speaking, with authority. Calley has zero of that. He doesn't listen to questions, his mind is racing trying to find words to put together an evasive and in his head, believable non-answer.

When the jabs came out, even before I studied up on the jab, I heard loudly in my soul! DON'T TAKE THIS!! Of course, afterward, I studied with various doctors like Dr. McCullough, etc. I watched the roundtable with Senator Ron Johnson, with doctors, scientists, patients, and representatives of close ones that died!!  Among many other studies that included world statistics!   I knew when""covid"" and  this jab came out.The world would never be the same! People would tell me that they took the jab and that the description of this jab, ingredients  and contraindications weren't on the paper with the box. It was blank!! Who would take that?? To see all of the deaths even in my own small family happen, I couldn't believe this was not taken off the market. I've heard the CEO of fizer State that they knew this didn't prevent immunity!! I also  knew instinctively the game was genocide, early on!!   Uncle Jack, I  remember the day that I realized that our government has been lying to us all along! I don't  think I will ever believe the gov't and any 3 lettered agencies  ever again!   Thank you again for this very important podcast!",@joyrittimann9846,1,0

"Why wasn't Calley called out for his psychological ploys used in this podcast? I respect moderators who moderate. Rules could be laid out in the beginning, then like a referee, he could shut down the ploy in play. Calley saying Jack's name, especially over and over, when Calley wanted to tamp him down? Psychological ploy to put Jack lower than Calley; childish. That should not have been allowed, and should have been called out and told to not do that again. That was difficult to watch and listen to. And, Calley wondering(?) why Jack gets so angry at him? That deflecting from the topic to put the audience's attention on Jack's 'supposed' faults, just shines the light on the obvious deflector's ruse (the ruse that Calley doesn't have much to stand on to convince himself nor the audience).

"The only thing worse than Calley‚Äôs smarmy tongue and untrustworthy physiognomy is Jack‚Äôs narcissistic and paranoid-shizo ranting and gaslighting. This whole thing is a train wreck and unwatchable. But I did anyway.2:52 ""I don't think they're personal attacks"" ‚Äì yeah Jack, questioning the authenticity of their mother's death would be considered personal.3:35 ""why isn't the word vakseen in your book once"" ‚Äì the word ""pharma"" is 16 times. did you notice that Danny didn't need to censor the word ""pharma"" on this youtube video? but he did censor ""vakseen""? perhaps being a little more strategic about extremely third rail hotwords in their book was intentional.11:10 ‚Äúshould the shots be pulled off the market‚Äù ‚Äì he‚Äôs policy stance is basically libertarian. Full data transparency and let the consumer decide.13:20 ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not the answer‚Äù ‚Äì Jack that‚Äôs not YOUR answer. It‚Äôs his. He‚Äôs advocating for a more measured strategy, instead of just having a new administration use fiat to shut everything down (as much as I would love that, it‚Äôs just not politically realistic) which is what he argues at 18:0021:30 people have meteoric growth in followers all of the time. They were on two of the biggest podcasts in the world. How is this sus?21:50 ‚Äúmaybe you can tell us your secret‚Äù ‚Äì yeah the secret is to be a little more subtle and maybe don‚Äôt excessively use the words that get you regularly suppressed29:30 Hey Jack, maybe not everyone knows about everything you just got done saying, and maybe attacking someone who wants it to have ‚Äúmaximum airtime‚Äù and ‚Äúsunlight‚Äù is counterintuitive.30:40 Is anyone who happened to intern at a suspect company while they were in college beyond redemption? Can people not be deep in the industry and then defect? Is this not allowed?37:30 Jack really thinks he‚Äôs Columbo by looking at Calley‚Äôs public LInkedin profile. Calley keeps acknowledging that the dark places he used to work in are not a secret and a ‚Äúfoundation‚Äù to his story. Jack‚Äôs like ‚Äúexactly‚Äù (insinuating he‚Äôs an op) and Casey‚Äôs like ‚Äúexactly‚Äù (insisting he‚Äôs a defector). This whole exchange is becoming insufferable.38:05 Calley: ‚ÄúI went to Stanford‚Äù Jack: ‚ÄúDarkness‚Äù. OK bud, Mary went there too remember.43:00 ‚Äúthe more you talk the bigger hole you dig‚Äù ‚Äì this is how Kafka traps work.44:10 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm saying anything‚Äù ‚Äì king level gaslighting. This entire discussion is under the premise that Jack thinks the Means are ops.44:26 Mary insinuates that because first time author success is rare, the Means are therefore ops. It‚Äôs not that rare. JK Rowling, Harper Lee, Margeret Mitchell, F Scott Fitzgerald, Malcolm Gladwell, Maya Angelou, et al found success in their first works.44:45 Enjoy your BPA lined can of ‚Äúwater‚Äù, Jack.45:10 ‚ÄúWord ‚Äòconspiracy‚Äô has only come out of your mouth‚Äù ‚Äì bro, this is why you‚Äôre pissing me off. You know what you‚Äôre inferring. Stop setting Kafka traps. 47:00 fair concern: is former PR guy still lying for someone? This would be a conspiracy. You are grilling Calley because you think there is a conspiracy. But Calley says the actual word ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù and it becomes proof of his guilt? Stop being a clown, Jack. I want to ride with you but you‚Äôre making it very hard.47:40 ‚Äúdid I get blasted off the internet?‚Äù ‚Äì Jack, you and Mary have already spoken about how difficult it is to get your message out because of the subject matter. You love splitting semantic hairs. You may not have had your accounts ‚Äúblasted‚Äù off the internet, but your content has been severely suppressed, said another way, ‚Äúblasted off the internet‚Äù.49:00 yes we do have a huge problem with trust, don‚Äôt we.49:45 Oh Mary went to Stanford? DARKNESS, right Jack?51:40 Mary and Casey have the same training from a DARK university. Who dropped out and who finished? See how easy it is to play this stupid game?52:45 Now Jack is moving into credentialism. You know, ‚Äútrust the experts‚Äù. ‚ÄúBelieve science.‚Äù ‚ÄúScience knows‚Äù. ‚ÄúCasey can‚Äôt even see patients like we can‚Äù. Jack, you sound like a shitlib. 1:02:00 I‚Äôm sorry man, but almost 80% of pancreatic cancer cases are diagnosed at stage 4. How this is some kind of evidence is beyond me.1:04:40 ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not a doctor‚Äù ‚Äì more credentialism. ‚ÄúTrust the expert‚Äù1:08:18 ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not a doctor; I am‚Äù ‚Äì how many times do we have to hear this? I thought we were the side of ‚Äúdo your own research‚Äù and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt trust the experts‚Äù1:08:25 ‚Äúis it normal to have a stage 4 pancreatic cancer diagnosis?‚Äù Yes. It is normal. 80% as previously noted. And as Calley goes on to say. But I‚Äôm not a doctor like Jack, so my information is not reliable.1:21:48 No Jack, the ‚Äúdrug dealers‚Äù here are the ones who distributed it, the DOD.1:24:20 ‚Äúgetting something done in this generation is about politics‚Äù Calley is 100% correct here. Jack and Mary are being completely undisciplined and emotional, and this is why their message will continue to hit walls. They are incapable of coalition building. You simply cannot stick a new administration in and expect them to drop an atom bomb on everything you don‚Äôt like. 1:26:20 I‚Äôm sorry man, but anyone who doesn‚Äôt get 100% on your platform being labeled as an op or a limited hangout or a fabian is just narcissistic and borderline paranoia. So you ‚Äúagree with everything you said on Rogan‚Äù but also, everything you say is a diversion tactic? Which is it?1:28:50 Another Kafka tactic. When someone responds with incredulity at being accused of being a massive wide reaching conspiracy operative, you act like that is further proof of their guilt. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt laughed at all‚Äù. Cool Jack, proud of you?1:37:45 ‚Äúyou‚Äôve not been eloquent at all‚Äù I don‚Äôt know, he sounds just like every other pod I‚Äôve heard him on. ‚ÄúIgnorance was fair game‚Äù no it never was Jack. You know the conclusion you were always going to come to.1:45:20 ‚Äútwo institutions that I hate‚Äù One of which is‚Ä¶ the one Mary went to, correct?1:45:40 You clearly have no problem confronting people, but you would turn down two of the biggest platforms in the world? But you went on Huberman‚Äôs? A Stanford (DARK) professor? Make it make sense, Jack.2:03:45 ‚ÄúBurn it down‚Äù You see what happens when ‚Äúyour guy‚Äù (Gaetz) gets close? He gets ‚Äúnon-factored‚Äù. Maybe the ‚Äúburn it down‚Äù guys isn‚Äôt the right tactic.2:08:20 ‚Äúwe need swift accountability‚Äù But don‚Äôt you first want all the information available and transparent so the people can be informed and on board with your accountability? Isn‚Äôt the transparency Calley is advocating for just a step towards mass accountability? Or you just want to send them to Guantanamo before the population has any idea what‚Äôs going on and why?2:11:20 Comparing Pearl Harbor to the health crisis is so incredibly stupid. No one demanded ‚Äútransparency‚Äù then before accountability because the transparency was illicit in the attack the moment it happened. It was done by Japan. Conversely, the average civilian has no idea who the perpetrators are in the health crisis because it is so widespread and multifaceted and spread across a half century at least. What a stupid comparison.2:14:20 Jack and Mary are having a heated debate with someone advising the new administration about topics that were untouchable like 2 seconds aga and they‚Äôre not optimistic because nobody is passing their purity test. Get a grip. Grow up. Learn how to win small before you win big.2:15:00 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the idiots‚Äù this is so immature and pathetic.2:15:53 ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a lobbyist‚Äù inferring that he‚Äôs a fraudster 2:16:20 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a fraudster, he‚Äôs just ignorant‚Äù Which is it?2:19:00 ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the guy on tucker and JRE bro‚Äù Jack you apparently could have been too, but you turned it down, because uhhhh reasons and purity or something.2:19:05 OK he‚Äôs a fraudster again.2:27:50 Again with the purity black pilling. Because the team isn‚Äôt 100% our guys, it‚Äôs so over. You really expect to have a perfect roster? Christ didn‚Äôt even have that. 2:45:00 This is correct. Norms need an easily accessible gateway. We all found had ours at some point along the way. The Means writing an anti vax book would have accomplished absolutely nothing. They would be nobodies.2:46:25 This is correct. Calley should have come in from the top with this counter. Jack is the actual subversive Agent Provocateur here. He should have accused Jack of ‚ÄúSalting‚Äù or ‚ÄúDead Catting‚Äù to subvert the MAHA movement just so we could get the immature paranoid Spiderman meme finger pointing out of the way. Instead we‚Äôve wasted 3 hours doing it.2:28:10 This is what I said already. The exact reason they have to bleep it out of the video. Use your brain Jack.At least it ended somewhat OK.",@jordogo,2,0

"One issue I take with jack is his uncontrolled intensity. He's always ready to connect the next dot, maybe even when there's no need to draw a connection between two stand alone issues. I've got no doubts that jack is intelligent and has done the legwork himself to bring himself to the current version of himself that has been convinced he's 100% correct in all things plastered on his spiral. It's hard to watch with accusations such as the guy's dad's book and a few other points similar to. At the end of all this there is room for cohesive direction and I just don't think jack will be an instrument in making progress in the mainstream. He's better left as the resource and research guy, imho. He's too abrasive due to his overly passionate emotions tied to his beliefs.
