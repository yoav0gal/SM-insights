"Johnny, your ""insightful"" beliefs that PRC/China does not get involved in foreign countries proxy war because of supposed foreign policy tenants just proved how much people in the west are mistaken about China.The overthrowing of Myanmmar's democratically elected government by the Militay Junta Regime is precisely because the previous democratic government was regarded by China as being too pro-US & favoring the west. Unlike the more direct, open approach from western powers, such as can be seen from attention-seeking headline news from Trump's tariffs annoucement, China's CCP regime prefers way more subtle approach in interference, sneaky, even insidious way infiltration by supporting their preferred factions through economic trade support as a legitimate front. Without PRC China strong support for Myammar Military Junta Regime, the factions gathered under the toppled Myammar  Governmnt could have retaken powers except they do not have other foreign nations with strong military powers backing them. & there is also support for Russia, in spite of all the sanctions from the west, Europe & USA, Russia still manage to function properly as a state for 3 years because Russia secured PRC China replacing & supplying the shortfalls of all those products & goods that Russia use to import from the west. So it is inaccurate to state that PRC China was not involved in proxy wars, since supplying military weapons & technologies is only one part of a modern proxy war. Furthermore, Russia's current wartime economy manage to churn out all its advance military hardwares which could not obtain needed western components, manage by replacing those with China supplied parts, whether supply directly in the guise of dual-use household electronics parts & products or re-routing these needed equipments through other nations like Iran/ North Korea etc. countries who first receive those components & parts from China directly.",@BTjs321456,0.0,0.0

The Korean war made it clear that the US never cared for the Koreans, as they shot thousands of South Koreans in the Nogeun Li massacre simply because they thought there could have been Communists among them. They were willing to end the lives of millions of Korean civilians just so their puppet regime wouldn't fall into enemy hands; the Soviet Union was not so different. Vietnam potentially could have ended up the same way as Korea.

"China's approach to warfare is profoundly influenced by 2,500 years of Confucian and Taoist philosophy. The classic text ""The Art of War"" offers valuable insights into this perspective. One significant concept is that of proxy wars, which highlight the harmful psychological impacts that ultimately damage a nation. For example, former President Carter discussed the United States' conflicts with other countries, noting that the long-term effects of the misleading narratives promoted by the U.S. War Department have weakened the nation economically.China recognizes that all forms of war lead to destruction, regardless of how much a nation invests. The crucial takeaway is to prioritize what truly matters for a country's advancement and the growth of its civilization. This focus has contributed to China's endurance over 4,000 years, driven by merit and the philosophy of fostering positive contributions to neighboring nations. Those in the West lacking a deep understanding of Chinese philosophy may struggle to fully grasp these concepts.",@padraicley3265,0.0,0.0

America.... if they do end up getting their rare earth mineral deal even more money. I feel like that's pulling a gun on someone that just got knocked out but just my 2 cents. Russia's economy is going to be in shambles once the war ends. They've showed all their hands. Lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers. Lost a lot of their top of the line kit.

"History rhymes.The events later called World Wars I and II were part of the same conflagration that began around 1900, when the naval powers encircled their continental neighbours. For the American Century after 1900, sitting on the globe's biggest ""fence"" (Atlantic Ocean/distance) while ""eating popcorn"" (waiting game), Europe was simply a slightly larger area than Britain was for Rome around the year ""0"": The technique used by both empires was the same, namely, exploiting existing divisions. Exploiting such divisions for one's own ends is the ""divide-and-rule/conquer"" strategy. A proactive means of advancing one's own interests at the expense of others is to favor some (increase the power of the favoured) at the expense of others (decrease the power of the outcast). In the initial stages while the UK kept its power to be the ""divider in in chief"" herself up to the 1940s, Washington DC did not have to engage much, apart from the overt favouritism of WW1, disguised behind the ""nice sounding story"".The OUTSIDERS' strategy was always ""if a local/limited war on the continent expands, then the engineered LONG war scenario,"" and this was declared BY the hegemon.  This is not different today than it was 100 years ago, 200 years ago, or 300 years ago. The OUTSIDERS who avoid avoiding war benefit if all others fight to mutual exhaustion. This will not be different today now that Zelenski has recognized how he had been duped into the long war by Boris Johnson (Istanbul proposals torpedoed, whilst ""blaming the other side""). For the ""divider,"" sitting on the fence watching, the multitude of reasons, motivations, ideologies, justifications, opinions, excuses, or the interests of those who cooperate in achieving the beneficial division for the higher power are not important. For the dividing power, it does not matter how the division is implemented, or how existing divisions are deepened, or who is helping for whatever reasons, or whether those who favor and abet the division even know that they are supporting the division: what matters is that division is implemented. For the outside divider with a geographical advantage of distance from violent events, it is not important why the chosen tools choose to work together for the gains of the empire, but the fact that the chosen tools work together to create division and overwhelm a part of the planet somewhere. ""How"" and ""that"" are different premises.The empire is in search of profit, only ""interests"" are important. There are more than enough examples of strategists who openly admit this. The apologists will never address this, since they instinctively realize that they BENEFIT from wars elsewhere. All these ""fence sitters"" have to do is wait for the crash, boom, bang, then sail in and benefit...The conflagration that took place after the 1990s have a prequel in European history, in the events of the 1890s up to 1914 and at Versailles. In case anybody doubts the validity of the above assessment I suggest a ""map"", upon which one can plot the encirclement of Central Europe after the 1890s. Maps are a primary source of information more valuable than words spoken by another human being, prone to lies and deception. This setup continued after WW1, with the only change being that instead of a small number of large ""encirclers,"" (pre-1914) there were now a large number of small ""encirclers"" (post-1919). The ""world war"" after 1914 was another European 30-year war (with a 20-year break in between). The divisions thus established around the year 1900 were:1) the naval powers (Britain/USA) with their continental allies as ""buck catchers"" (such as France after 1904 and Russia after 1907) favouring long wars.set up against:2) the continental alliances favouring short wars, which were encircled and prevented from reaching sufficient spheres of influence for their growth by the naval supremacy of 1), and this encirclement strategy began as a deliberate action by the naval powers around 1900.The Albion used its unassailable GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION on the map to play games, not ONLY in Europe, but globally:Divide-and-gain (power for own systems).If not.Divide-and-control (a situation from the high ground).If not.Divide-and-rule (by drawing lines on the map, weakening others, etc.).If not.Divide-and-conquer (markets, sphere of influence, whatever).If not.Divide-and-destroy (those who refuse to bow down to exploitation and division).This strategy was simply repeated after a short respite called the Cold War (1945-1991), with the 1990's Wolfowitz Doctrine/US imperialist claim to power with ""US primacy"" as the top priority, and Yugoslavian unity the first victim on the marching route.  Written down in strategy papers, for all to see. This time around the ""targets"" of the global strategy of divide-and-rule were not Central Europe/Central Powers (Treaty of Versailles, and others), but rather China and Russia. The new default rivals were shifted further east. The final goal of our off-continental (non-Eurasian) ""friends"" in Washington DC is to crush China as they once crushed Europe, then carve it up into little pieces like they did with Europe, via their ""friends"" the UK and France (London and Paris), using the block mentality of blockheads, in the form of divided neighbours as ""tools"" on a ""chessboard"" and later claim total innocence and ""world saviour""-status for themselves. After a short halt called ""Cold War"", the march of the empire continued, on the marching route of the empire, which started when the USSR economically faltered in the late-1980s.Systemic/ideological expansion into, as concerted effort called divide-and-rule.- Eastern Europe.- Balkans/Black Sea/Caucasus region (southern pincer of advance).- Baltic/Scandinavia (northern pincer of advance).This was simply the continuation of the scheme to overpower Russia which dated from WW1, to make use of the weakness created by 3 years of war (1914-17/Eastern Front) exhausting and extending all. Therefore, it was never in the ""interest"" of the victors to achieve a fair balance of powers in Europe, as was the case in 1815 (balance of power/Concert of Europe). The intention was to create an IMbalance of powers as foundation, which could be exploited, regardless of what the political doves thought they were doing. Keep on marching, marching, and when there is a reaction or resistance (aka ""defensive realism"") by those encroached upon or encircled, get the propagandists to start ""pointing fingers"" (narrative control) at those being encircled or encroached upon.  This type of imperialist behaviour as evident by Washington DC, and their subservient ""collective West/NATO"", did not only start after WW2. Ask the First Nations, or Mexico.Because of the own ideological indoctrination (something gladly attributed to others, aka ""finger pointing"") and proudly stated by such tropes as being ""good guys"" or ""on right side of history"" and being an ""indispensable nation"", the encirclers will never admit their own corruption because they feel better about the realities they have imposed on their neighbours either directly or by proxy, and do not intend to follow a simple moral logic of a strategy of power called the GOLDEN RULE: ""Don't do unto others what you do not want done to you.""  Do you want to be encircled and encroached upon? Then do not do it to others. If you cannot follow such a simple logic, you must follow the logic of causality where there is a muddy trench waiting for you.  Note: not these so-called ""leaders"" who deceive you here. For you, personally, the one reading this. The bunker boys and manipulators are safely tucked away in the bunkers, chanting slogans from their ""mommy's basements"", or hiding behind their keyboards (keyboard warriors), hoping they'll never end up where they cheer for.The current ""Greenland narrative"" is nothing else but systemic expansion, started in 1776 and never stopped. An insatiable empire, hiding behind a narrative. Fact is that during WW1 planners in London, Washington DC and Paris were already planning their war against Russia in 1918, as systemic expansion, and needed ""new best fwiends"" (Eastern Europeans) to sacrifice as proxies, doing most of the fighting and dying, while they stood off and used their navies to ""nibble around the edges"" of Russia, and later step in with systemic expansion, and systemic profit and gain. Why is this a fact? Because it actually happened. This habit of finding proxies to do most of the fighting and dying repeated after the 1990s, looking for Slavic people who could be set up against their neighbours. Trust the Albion once, and you are in its ""fangs"" forever...Today?History is repeating.Albion 2.0Anybody who ""believes"" WW1/WW2 ever ""ended"" is already the fool, sacrificing himself for the systemic expansion and gain of ""friends"".Imagine not knowing what WW1 and WW2 was about, and getting emotionally triggered every time your ideological standpoint is contested. WW1 and WW2 was about the destruction of the European balance of power, est. 1815, and this destruction was carried out by OUTSIDE ideologues, who entered Europe ""Trojan Horse""-style, initially into the UK and France (destruction of the reign of monarchy, ""sold"" to the plebs as an ""advantage""), and other countries on the fringes of Europe, intent on systemic gain. They used tools (aka ""proxies"") to do most of the fighting and dying for them. The Treaty of Versailles was the first attempt to keep Germany ""down"" in European/global affairs, Russia ""out"" of European/global affairs, and the USA ""in"" (Lord Ismay) European/global affairs. It only failed because the USA did not sign up. The USA could afford to wait. Distance = impunity = advantage.This is divide-and-rule.",@RalfBernhard-g1c,0.0,0.0

"Don't think I can agree with your take about China, I really don't believe they're doing out of principle, they're just using a more covert and subtle way. I think a big difference here is that most countries culture have a set values and worldview, and they're more or less make decision according to it, but the CCP rn is more interest focus rather than having a rigid worldview, as long as it benefits the CCP regime and gives them good reputation, they can do ANYTHING, even adopting a certain degree of capitalism for example. As an ethnic Han asian I can tell you, this kind of attitude is complete in line with how most of us live, alot of us think having a rigid conviction or beliefs is somewhat stupid, our values, worldview, religions, lifestyle, relationship ALL comes down to whether or not is serves our own benefits & interests. Hence the idea of societal change via revolution, or like willing to sacrifice my whole being for a particular cause, are very foreign to alot of Chinese, since these are more or less concept rooted in Abrahamic religions. The West need to start to be aware of this, otherwise we're just gonna keep misjudging them, and they'll continue to be the ""smart"" one in geopolitics.",@josephdee4649,0.0,0.0
"We have a new type of proxy war: A civil proxy war. The U.S has one currently happing. The government has brainwashed it's people with propaganda to side them by making them believe what they want like migrants or illegal migrants, the using religion as to control, promising change in ecconomy, use of intimidation, double moral use of standards, cutting education,etc. They use a little bit of truth, yet lie about everything else to gain credibility. All of this to manipulate to create an war. While this serves as a distraction of all the currupt movement they are doing. And the government is not fighting for this civil proxy war.

Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russel (foreign minister) never wavered on this and rebuffed Confederate agents repeatedly.

Which arguably is the smarter strategy, it's harder to maintain a war so far away, considering costs to ship soldiers, weapons, and equipment... the US has wasted tens of TRILLIONS of dollars on all these silly wars, bankrupting the American people. Think back to how rich the US middle class was in the 50s. Then think of the quality of life and social instability in the 60s and 70s.  The wars on the opposite side of the globe and ocean, I think, played a huge part in our decline as a nation, the decline and deterioration of quality of life of the middle class, and the slowing down of technological innovation, rising costs of housing and medicine.  If we spent those trillions on our own citiziens, our infrastrucutre, our technological innovation and productive capacity, we would be twice ahead of China. China only got ahead because they stayed out of these stupid costly wars that had no positive result. And look at the allies we made from these wars. Europe cheats us on trade and then says we are ""unrealiable partners"" because we don't want to be carrying their weight for free anymore, and they have ZERO intention of repaying the favor that we provided them for 80 years. No gratitude at all. We are protecting their trade routes in the middle east, and provide aircraft carrier strike groups, troops, intelligence sharing, and nuclear umbrella to protect them for 80 years. Meanwhile, we have gotten poorer and while they laugh at us and our horrible medicare system, our horrible chemical food products, without showing a lick of gratitude in how we essentiallize subsidized their quality of life and their way of life. They would all be speaking German today if it weren't for us, or perhaps Russian, and living under a very different quaity of life and culture today if we didn't protect them and allow them to essentially do whatever they wanted while we protected them. And I don't think they ever repayed us or thanked us for it. Meanwhile, we created enemies that hate us so much they can keep recruiting random people of theirs, or even ours, to suicide themselves with bomb vests or planes or cars, to kill as many of us as possible in acts of terror.  China doesn't have terrorism or insane crime like that. Because they don't meddle in others' affairs, and its payed off for them. Our meddling hasn't payed off, not at all.  We have different segments of ""the free world"" that don't even respect or care about helping us.  They haven't had to fight to protect our security, sure they helped in the fights in the middle east, in Operation Desert Storm and others, but these were all lost causes to begin with.  All the extremist groups we killed just regrew two new heads for each we chopped off, because for each ""terrorist"" we kill, two civilians or children are killed in the crossfire, and then maybe 4 new terrorists are created. No reason to get involved in these places that don't want us there, seriously. Learn from China, do better and be better. Let American military protect Americans, and allies that are willing to PAY UP for the service of protecting their freedom and way of life.  Instead we've done it for free and asking to be payed back is met with hostility, like a disrespectful gambling addict who keeps borrowing money from loan sharks and acting insulted that they demand to be payed back. Maybe we should stop doing free favors for countries that don't appreciate it, and let them figure it out, until they learn to appreciate it and find ways of equalizing with us. China doesn't have these issues because they don't waste trillions on military aid for other countries. No other country in the world does what the US does.

"The last part of the video is just wrong. The PRC has done proxy wars frequently throughout its history. Korea and Vietnam were mentioned in the episode, but more recently they armed and funded ZANU against ZAPU in Zimbabwe. Their support was key in lengthening the genocide in Cambodia. They supported various sides in the Angolan civil war and the Iran-Iraq War.In all of this, you have to recognize the agency of the people on the ground. Koreans actually fought for Korean reasons, not because they had puppet-masters in other countries (except for the very end of the war, on one side, when Johnny's right that Stalin really did prolong the war). Secondly, you have to be careful with generalizing all of this to ""powerful countries"" as if the actions of the USA, USSR, and PRC are morally equivalent. You might have noticed that in all the examples that Johnny mentioned during the Cold War--Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan--the US was helping independent peoples defend themselves from communist tyranny.And if you have a problem with the term ""communist tyranny"" then you should do a quick Wikipedia walkthrough of the gulag slave labor camp system, laogai, Great Leap Forward, dekulakization, and the Cultural Revolution. There's a reason the US was so opposed to communism spreading (you can take the analogy of ""why was the US so obsessed with stopping fascism in WWII?""--that sounds like a stupid objection right? Now try saying ""why was the US so obsessed with stopping communism in the Cold War?""--because it was bad, y'all.)",@mattbristley7828,6.0,3.0

The kind you would put in practice in a videogame. I know anyone would.

"I think the last part about China is wrong. First, China actively supports Russia in Ukraine, they increased everything to support Russia, except weapons. But it‚Äôs not same trade volume as before the war, it clearly increased. This war shows that China has leverage over Russia. Without China, Russia could not keep up feeding the military industrial complex right now. China could end this war if they would want. Second, China‚Äôs military interests are huge, don‚Äôt believe anything that the party tells officially, about economics, stability or peace. The party lies all the time in order to look good, and that they can be in power in China. They don‚Äôt want peace, and the don‚Äôt have peace at their borders. Many of China‚Äôs borders are under great tension, because of China. They don‚Äôt wanna have peace, they wanna have influence and power. You think they don‚Äôt wanna fight the US? They hate the US, recently because they think COVID came from US (because of the Russian propaganda at that time). Even young people think this, because of the information control within China. China hates the US and they are ready to fight the US. But the officials lie in their public statements in the same way the Trump administration or the Putin regime lies all the time. It‚Äòs literally the same with China. No difference. Don‚Äôt believe the Chinese lies. You will see, everybody will see, they will fight and they will fight hard. Now it‚Äôs still preparation time for China not fight time. So now they just talk about trade deals, economics and bla bla. Similar strategy than the Russian‚Äòs. Russia also played long time good influence in Europe before the attack (the Russian oligarchs in UK and FC Chelsea, Nordstream with Germany etc). Before they just prepared. Once the time was right then they started the full scale war. Same story with China. They prepare now, with economics and I‚Äòm the good Chinese friend etc. Later they will go to hot war.

"China not meddling in foreign internal affairs is hardly true. China engages in proxy wars just like everyone else. China is currently funding the UWSA in Myanmar as their direct proxy, and continues to sell arms to the Myanmar military. China funds non-state militias to harass Vietnam, the Philippines, and half of SEA. Historically, China was either a belligerent and propped up their proxies in half of the examples you shared, from Korea to Cambodia. And that's just direct military aid - if Ukraine is a proxy war, then China is propping up Russia as their ""proxy"" by keeping their economy alive and bypassing western sanctions. China has fingers around the globe and is gaining power and position through diplomatic and economic means - just look at Somaliland and Sri Lanka. If China doesn't meddle in international affairs, then why does the PLA SSF publicly conduct disinformation campaigns in other countries against Taiwanese, Tibetan, Uyghur, and Hong Kong?

"Summary (Powered by ConciseGPT)Highlights:- Definition of Proxy War:  - A proxy war occurs when external parties instrumentalize a conflict, using it as a stand-in for their larger disputes.- Advantages for Great Powers:  - Proxy wars offer great powers deniability, allow them to avoid sacrificing their own citizens, and contain violence within another country's borders.- Cold War Examples:  - The Korean War, Vietnam War, and the conflict in Afghanistan exemplify how the US and the Soviet Union used proxy wars to fight each other indirectly, spreading their influence and ideologies.- Post-Cold War Shift:  - The end of the Cold War did not reduce proxy wars; instead, they increased due to the rise of multiple global powers and the lower cost of supporting proxy forces.- Modern Proxy Wars:  - Conflicts in Libya, Syria, and Sudan demonstrate how proxy wars have become longer, deadlier, and more resistant to peace due to multiple patrons supporting different factions.- Ukraine as a Half-Proxy War:  - The conflict in Ukraine is described as a ""half proxy war"" because while Ukraine is supported by the West against Russian aggression, Russia itself is deeply engaged and views the conflict as existential.- China's Approach:  - China has largely avoided engaging in proxy wars, adhering to a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, although this is being tested in situations like the civil war in Myanmar.Key Insights:- Changing Nature of Warfare:  - Direct wars between major powers have become less common due to the threat of nuclear weapons, leading to the rise of proxy wars as the primary means of geopolitical competition.- Increased Complexity:  - Modern proxy wars are more complex than those during the Cold War due to the presence of multiple patrons, making conflicts harder to resolve and prolonging the violence.- Deadly Equilibrium:  - Proxy wars often reach a ""dynamic equilibrium"" where external supporters provide just enough assistance to keep the conflict going but not enough to achieve a decisive victory, leading to protracted and devastating wars.- Local Perspectives:  - While proxy wars are often analyzed from the perspective of great powers, it's crucial to understand the motivations of local groups who may seek external support as a means of survival or to achieve their own objectives.- Potential for Escalation:  - The conflict in Ukraine highlights the risk of escalation in proxy wars, especially when a major power views the outcome as existential, potentially leading to broader and more dangerous confrontations.```",@ConciseGPT,0.0,0.0

"Funny enough, I had this realization several months ago. Actually if you go back to every major civil war, there is always some level of foreign influence or assistance, often by a country or side that is at odds with the country. And also, that every ""Independence movement"" is actually very simply a civil war that was successful, and if it wasn't successful, we just refer to it as a civil war, without the romanticization of it being a fight for independence. But I guarantee you that any group that takes up arms against their own country is fighting for their independence and freedom and autonomy, to either separate from the country. There is always the side that fights for the country and its authority and dominance over the smaller group, and that group which wants to break away and have its own autonomy and freedom, and be free from what they see as an oppressive authority that makes laws against them they don't want.  Another thing about nation states, there will always be winners and losers within the country, there are those who are subsidized (the recipient of more tax dollars than they payed) and those who are subsidizees (the ones that pay more taxes than they receive). For example, in America, there are mining towns in very sparsely populated states like Idaho or Montana that create insane amounts of wealth in a very small space, a single mining town. However, they are taxed very highly and see alot of that wealth go to the federal government, which then gets sent into cities and urban centers in all shapes and sizes, from low-income housing grants, to investment in infrastructure that only benefits those in cities, to student scholarship grants that only help those going to college. All of these things are payed for by people who will not benefit in any way from those policies. This is what creates and builds resentments inside a country by groups of people towards the central authority/government and becomes the source of a ""civil war"".  Groups that feel being taken advantage of, and seeing a government that doesn't equally represent their interests based on their own notions of fairness.  As another example to that effect, there is a growing sentiment in America that the weight of someone's representation in the government should be based on how much you're putting in, like if you're in the class of people paying hundreds of thousands in taxes each year, you should have more representation in the government than a bunch of people who are paying zero dollars in taxes. This is a hotly contested issue ofcourse, but this difference in views about ""fairness"" is really the driving motivation for ""rebellious"" activity that can ultimately lead to ""civil war"" or physical conflict involving many armed skirmishes over weeks, months, years.  This is what the Revolutionary War was in American against Britain. It is also what the American Civil War was, with the South against the north. There still exists sentiments in these highly productive smaller towns, whose labors support the financing and growth of the urban centers, but never see any reward or payoff for such things.  In some very indirect ways, maybe a new technological innovation in an urban center may occasionally offer benefits to these places to improve farming and agriculture practices, productivity, or mining safety, etc.  And this caveat might be the only thing that appeases those resentments, besides the threat of retaliation by the federal government.  But if everyone that payed more taxes than they got back unionized together into a single massive union, and threatened to stop paying their taxes in unison, this would essentially be a declaration of civil war, as it threatens the survival of the country bu threatening the authority of the country, which relies on that tax money to operate.  In any case, the realization that every civil war is also almost always instigated or assisted by a foreign power attempting to undermine the authority of that country, is a big realization. The US for example only broke awake from Britain because France wanted to deprive them of the American colonies. It became the battle ground for a war between Britain and France that had already been in fierce conflict in the past. This itself was a proxy war for them.  However, then France had its own civil war, so in some ways it could be seen as a group inside France was using American fight for independence as a way to get a foothold in American influence that would then support their own movement for independence, except not to break away from their own country, but to completely displace the current monarchy authority in place of their own selected authority, DEMOCRACY! And they ended up with Napoleon who for a short time adopted the name of King, and they treated him as if royalty.  Not to get too off track though, it's important to simply realize there is always bigger forces at play when two smaller forces start fighting. It's an opportunity for the larger forces to find advantages against their rivals. Any sort of power struggle or instability is seen as a way to build influence, to support a side, and if they win they become more friendly and favorable to you, and thus you have new allies in high places. The US has done this quite alot in South America and in the Middle East. However when you support a side that loses, it really does not bode well for your image and world authority. Makes you look bad, like a loser, and the people there will remember and resent you. This is happening in Africa towards France, as Russia displaces French military presence there and thus their influences there.",@SorryMyNameWasTaken,0.0,0.0

Here russian invaded, like their army entered internationally recognized borders of Ukraine (twice 2014, 2022). 3. US, UK, russian, Ukraine signed Budapest memorandum, which said: Ukraine gets rid of the nukes, others will make sure Ukraine is safe. So they are helping not extend their influence, but because they talked Ukraine into destroying their nukes. Scale and consistency is a question that we should ask them. 4. Finally, we, Ukrainians, don't fight for US, UK, EU interest, this our existential war, our independence war from blood hungry despot russians that for centuries were oppressing nations in this part of the world.

I'm confused. Proxy Wars are as old as the Romans and Chinese. And this type of warfare been new norm for war since the 50s. The Cold War was literally built on this. We are just seeing a new Cold War.The only thing that's new is that we are seeing some proxy states having immense soft power over their patron states (through groups like AIPAC and CUFI).,@kingace6186,0.0,0.0

"Everyone wants to believe that as a species we have advanced and that the world super powers have invented some new way to fight. The reality on the ground is still dying in the trenches, attacking supply lines, and begging foreign powers for men and material to fight their enemies in your home. Surprisingly little has changed since the 18th century. At the end of the day the we are still trying to secure resources and strategic positions. We are still using men on the ground to do it. Same as it has always been. The French helped the US fight a proxy war with the British. The Russians gave material to the Union forces during the civil war to fight the Confederates who had British support. The only thing to change was that after ww2 we came up with all these conventions and treaties wrongly thinking that we could occupy and administer land we don't own in perpetuity without killing everyone that opposes us.",@adamrou12345,0.0,0.0

"Historical Inaccuracies I noticed in Johnny's video1) CCP winning the Chinese civil war was not a major blow to the United States at the time. Nationalist forces had been significantly weakened by Japan during WW2. Russian aid helped but was not the key factor, CCP was going to win regardless.2) Johnny briefly alludes to this but DPRK wanted to invade the ROK far more than USSR wanted to. After a year of talks Stalin greenlit the invasion once Soviets had their own nukes and could protect themselves from back splash. I feel like Johnny was incorrectly implying the Soviets were the driving force when they were not.3) Flat out inaccuracy, the US did not have troops in Korea at the start of the war. This was one of the initial issues for the Americans, lack of battle ready units in the region.4) Johnny implies China was acting as a proxy to USSR in the Korean War. Reality is CCP and USSR had tense relations and CCP was acting more in its own service than in the service of USSR. China counter invaded the peninsula to ensure the Americans didn't get a foothold directly on their own border. China is more of a 3rd Patron in this conflict than a 3rd Proxy.5) Escalating the conflict for years is a bit misleading. Its true that if the US did not intervene the DPRK would have soundly defeated the ROK in a matter of months. But US and CCP involvement really only escalated things for about another year. From then on it was basically a stalemate for another 2 years until armistice agreement.6) Johnny says Stalin ""knew his side couldnt win"" which is highly misleading given that at this point in the war it had developed into a stalemate. Johhny is implying DPRK was losing when in reality the situation was stabilized. Also remember CCP is the main fighting force on the ground and while Stalin has sway, USSR and China are both Patrons, its not a Patron - Proxy relationship like USSR with DPRK.7) Johnny's implication that the Korean war destroyed the peninsula all so great powers could fight each other is honestly B.S. DPRK and ROK had been begging to fight each other since the end of WW2. They both actively wanted great powers to intervene and help their side win. Korean war is a great example of a proxy war, its not an example of great powers wanting to fight each other so they use a 3rd country's people and territory as collateral.Johnny spending so much time on Korea and getting a lot wrong, and then barely mentioning Vietnam which much better suits his overall point is a weird decision.",@zacharynavarra7312,753.0,54.0
