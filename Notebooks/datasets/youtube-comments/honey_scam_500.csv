"I barely used honey. But the times I did I was glad. As I didn‚Äôt really look around for discount codes anyway, so to me as a consumer, even if not offered the best coupon, I still saved more than what I would have to search for a code.<br><br>However, I don‚Äôt often associate myself with affiliate links anyway, as unfortunately I find many affiliate links are YouTubers promoting something they probably never use or ever cared to really even try.<br><br>I think honey is a massive scam after finding this out and it‚Äôs very unethical, but I also find many, many YouTubers promoting garbage in return for their commission. While there may be great YouTubers out there who generally look for the best partnerships with their affiliates, I find more than not, they are promoting garbage. <br><br>Although honey may be stealing commissions, and they should have action taken against them, I don‚Äôt care so much for the YouTubers who lost out because they promoted garbage. <br><br>I saved money I wouldn‚Äôt have, do I feel conned? Maybe a little. But I never fully believed it tried finding me the best deal regardless. <br><br>I feel sorry for the legit YouTubers. But when it all comes down to it, YouTubers are conning us and trying to pick the best affiliates in terms of how much money they can make, rather than giving legit recommendations with smaller commissions, something needs to be done based off both scenarios.",@zZULTIMATEPROZz,0,0

"I think making this so focused on youtubers actually misses a huge part of what makes this so scummy. <br><br>Youtubers drive a tiny proportion of traffic to merchant sites in comparison to everything else. What about the commissions that merchants (the company who you&#39;re buying from) had to pay out to Honey when they really hadn&#39;t referred users at all, nobody had. Just by simply having an affiliate program, they were paying commission on ALL SALES with honey present regardless of if there even was an existing referrer - so that would include sales from just googling them, responding to a tv ad, your friend sending you there. <br><br>This has been attempted many times before by lots of voucher code companies and the merchants can simply ban the affiliate (in this case honey) for breaking their ts &amp; cs - why didn&#39;t they just do that? <br><br>Affiliate marketing reporting is traditionally pretty opaque and often on the client side it&#39;s managed by a junior member of staff, so much commission fraud takes place day in day out that it&#39;s great to see real focus on the morality of these programs.",@saysomestuff,2,4

"<b>News:</b> A creator of Honey was recently accused of using GPL-licensed code in one of their other extensions without adhering to the terms of the license. To clarify, the GPL (General Public License) requires that any software using GPL-licensed code must also be licensed under the GPL. This ensures that the benefits of open-source contributions are shared with the community, fostering transparency and collaboration.<br><br>As a developer, I find this particularly egregious. Violating a GPL license is not just a breach of legal obligations‚Äîit&#39;s also a serious ethical issue within the development community. Misusing open-source code without proper attribution and licensing undermines the trust and principles that make open source viable. It&#39;s one of the most frowned-upon actions in software development and is widely regarded as theft of intellectual property.",@TroubledTrooper,2,0
