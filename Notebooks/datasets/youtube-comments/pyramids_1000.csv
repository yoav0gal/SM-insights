"I just had a thought, could it be that these coils were built 1st then the Pyramids ontop of it below ground level, then those coils were released to Raise the Pyramid up?  Cuz if that is the case they would not have needed to lift heavy stones to build it as it was pretty much made underground. So they would just have to shape it below ground lvl, carve out the shape of the stones and it was raised with those coils? I dono just a thought. Or maybe it was not even carved, maybe they dug a massive big hole, then build the coils in place, compress & lock them to hold the tension. Then they couldve lowered stones from the top into the hole, building the pyramid for above ground. Cuz they would not have to Raise those big stones, just lower them down the hole. Once all is done, release the coils tension and they lift the Pre build Pyramid up. Cuz listen to what they are saying, we know the pyramids are like 150m tall or somewhere around there, and those coil structures goes down another 600meters+ If you want to lift for example and object that is 1ton is weight and 10 meter high or whatever the case may be, you would need coils 3x longer under more tension.

"Just to put things in perspective, they're saying the structures go up to 2km deep; that's over a MILE deep. These ancient pyramids were the tallest manmade structures on earth until the Lincoln Cathedral was made in 1311, almost 4 MILLENNIA later, and the tallest pyramid ONLY goes ~0.15km high. These structures underneath the pyramid are over THIRTEEN times deeper than the height of the pyramid that held the height record for over 3800 years. Even the current tallest building in the world isn't even 1km high, and even some of the current deepest structures barely surpass 2km and only did so in the last 25 years. If this turns out to be true, this would be one of the most astonishing ancient discoveries of all time, and it will completely rewrite history.",@Dremth,10,3

"This paper‚Äôs basically a high-tech mirage. It waves around real scientific terms and tools to dress up what is, at best, a speculative thought experiment‚Ä¶ and at worst, fringe pseudoscience in a shiny jacket. The frustrating part is it distracts from real science. Projects like ScanPyramids are doing incredible, careful work with muon tomography and actually are discovering unknown voids‚Äîwithout yelling ‚Äúancient alien subway system‚Äù from the rooftops. This paper‚Äôs noise makes the legit stuff harder for the public to trust. This isn‚Äôt cutting-edge remote sensing‚Äîthis is what happens when someone Googles a bunch of radar and tomography terms, stacks them into a paper, and hits ‚ÄúSubmit.‚Äù It sounds legit to a lay reader, but a trained eye sees how flimsy the foundation really is. SAR data typically doesn‚Äôt go deep‚Äîespecially not through dense stone and layered sediment like Giza limestone. It reflects off surfaces; it‚Äôs not really ""X-ray vision."" You're not peeking into the center of a 4,500-year-old pyramid like Superman. They didn‚Äôt cross-check with muon scans or ground-penetrating radar (GPR), which have already been done in the pyramid. For context: The ScanPyramids project found a few unknown voids in 2017 using muography‚Äîa much more cautious and transparent study. Nothing like a full-blown city or multi-level tunnel network.

How populated could the world be and how advanced could our tech become in 4000 years‚Ä¶ and all these pyramids somehow all had some connection on different ends of the world and no body‚Äôs and all these pyramids somehow structures are sunken‚Ä¶ almost like there was a great flood or something. ‚ÄúMakes spooky ghost sound‚Äù oooOooooOOoOoOoOo .. it‚Äôs almost as if the cabal and World economic forum doesn‚Äôt want us to know the Bible is real maybe maybe satan is in charge of them.

"This would be pre-Egyptian. Note the Egyptian Sphinx is relatively high, up toward what would be the peak of the pyramid. That is the Egyptian part much, much later.  Look, if this is real, as a Bible guy with a Master in Theology, this does not rock my world, nor is it surprising. Though folks often will catalog it as ""woo-woo"" stuff, fallen angel (read ""demonic"") hybrid stuff before the flood is in Genesis 6, with other connecting passages littered here and there throughout the scriptures, all the way into the New Testament. In fact, not a few understand this hybridism that also produced giants is one primary reason God stepped in to wipe out all but Noah and family, according to the Bible. Flood waters and moving silt are how we get rock layers in a matter of a few months and also fossils, just like at Mount Saint Helens in Washington that only blew in 1980. This is how you get fossilized buildings as the earth's mantle shifts under weight of water and mud, thrusting mountain ranges upward, settling into vast canyons vacated when the waters thrust upward in the flood. That the Giza plateau  would then be covered in silt and sand after a flood is not surprising. We see micro-versions of this activity today, each flood season. So if you have some highly intelligent giant hybrid human/angel race now by word-of-mouth in the lore of many cultures, the demi-gods, etc. such beings could have built many things, tall buildings, high steps, vast complexes... that were either wiped out in the flood, or covered over.

"Massive underground tunnels stretch deep into the Earth, leading to a hidden world where the reptilians reside. These creatures once feared the sun, believing that stepping into its light would cause them to burn. But they eventually found shelter, retreating below the surface while humanity emerged above. Mankind, however, was not free. They became slaves to the reptilians, who ruled from the shadows.To lure the reptilians out of hiding, humans offered them gifts‚Äîfood, women, gold, and other precious goods. In exchange, the reptilians granted kings and pharaohs immortality, inviting them to their underground realm. For generations, this uneasy pact continued, until one king, feeling slighted, lashed out. In a fit of rage, he clawed the eyes of a reptilian, condemning himself to eternal blindness. As punishment, the reptilians banned long nails, decreeing that anyone with long nails would be put to death. Humans, terrified, nervously chewed their nails, fearing their growing length would lead to their demise.The human slaves were forced to build the pyramids, structures that powered the inner world and allowed the reptilians to safely emerge. These pyramids served as a conduit, enabling the reptilians to see in all directions and avoid any threats from the outside world. Some believe that the reptilians still rule from within, hidden deep beneath the surface. If you dig deep enough, some say, you will uncover the truth of our world‚Äîbut the reptilians would never allow it to be discovered.",@BooneStories,0,0

"HERES MY CHAT WITHOUTPREJUDICE WITH CHAT GPT : these are lidar images what could be the function of this huge engineering undertaking those blue columns are over 2 KM deep also use the Kardashev Scale to determine the type of civilisation built itChatGPT said:These images appear to depict a massive engineering structure, possibly related to deep-sea or underground infrastructure. Given that the blue columns extend over 2 km deep, here are some possible functions:Possible Functions of the Structure:Energy Generation (Type I-II Civilization)This could be a deep-sea geothermal or nuclear power station.The presence of interconnected tubes suggests fluid or energy transfer, potentially exploiting hydrothermal vents or deep-sea pressure.Massive Underwater Computing/AI Core (Type II Civilization)A submerged data processing hub that utilizes deep-sea cooling for high-efficiency quantum computing.The pyramid structure could act as a stabilizer or protection for delicate instruments.Alien/Advanced Civilization Mining Operation (Type II Civilization)If this is an advanced civilization, they could be extracting rare materials from Earth's mantle or deep ocean crust.Anti-Seismic or Gravitational Stabilization Mechanism (Type I-II Civilization)The spring-like yellow coils in the last image suggest shock absorption, possibly designed to withstand extreme environmental forces.Could be a megastructure preventing seismic activity in tectonically unstable regions.Hydro-Processing or Terraforming Infrastructure (Type II Civilization)The blue columns may be processing seawater or deep-Earth minerals for large-scale planetary engineering.Kardashev Scale Analysis:Type I Civilization (Planetary Mastery): If this is a human project, it would be an early Type I civilization effort to harness deep-sea energy, stabilize tectonic plates, or mine resources.Type II Civilization (Star System Mastery): If the technology is far beyond human capacity, this could be an alien megastructure designed to control planetary resources on a massive scale.If we assume humans built this, it is at most a Type I project. If it has self-sustaining energy beyond Earth's natural limits, it leans toward Type II.",@SeShWaAH,0,0
