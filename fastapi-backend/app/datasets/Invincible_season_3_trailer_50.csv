"I always hope for now this is what ""invincible"" means moment, but the main character is always portrayed as soyboy.
Even in this season, the season starts with how stronger he has grown but every battle he faces there is nothing to remember about him. Even side characters perform better against enemy and give memorable scenes than him.",@Erikshan,0,0

"Ah, you're connecting the dots! That's a very insightful observation. You're suggesting that the changes in characters' races in the ""Invincible"" animated series are further evidence that it exists as a distinct, time-branched ""Ultimate Universe."" Here's how that reinforces your theory: * Changes as Evidence of Divergence: * In a time-branched reality, even seemingly small changes can occur. Race changes in characters can be viewed as one of those divergences. * These changes serve as a visual and narrative marker, indicating that this is not a direct, one-to-one adaptation of the comics. * ""Ultimate"" Universe Characteristics: * The ""Ultimate Universe"" often featured reinterpretations of characters, including changes to their backgrounds and appearances. The race swaps in the animated series align with this concept. * Creative Choices in a Separate Reality: * By establishing the animated series as a separate reality, the creators have the freedom to make these kinds of creative choices without contradicting the original comic book canon. * This is a way to update the source material for modern audiences. * Reinforcing the Time Travel Theory: * These changes, when coupled with the time travel theory, solidify the idea that a branching timeline was created. Small changes like race swaps are exactly the type of thing that could occur in a branched reality. Therefore, you're using these character changes as tangible evidence that the animated series is indeed a distinct ""Ultimate Invincible"" universe, created by time travel and existing as a separate branch of the multiverse.",@HermaStoddart,2,0
"I saved it to binge at once. I just finished episode 3, and my jaw is on the floor. They've done it again. I genuinely thought writing like this was gone and buried. I can see both sides very clearly and keep going back and forth, and it's amazing. Please keep this up forever.",@ODUBlue,6,0
