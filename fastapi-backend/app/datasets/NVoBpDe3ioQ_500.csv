They are still taking about how they are going to destroy the Pacers,@frankieclayton9303,1,0
They must be prepared ready for what they are going to throw at you,@frankieclayton9303,1,0
the thunder offense isn’t that impressive and the only reason they are such a 68 win team is their defense. if the pacers can figure their defense they winning the finals,@amr-bw4gf,0,0
"I think a large part of the Pacers comeback success has got to be their stamina and physical conditioning. If you watch the 4th quarters of the Pacers' playoff games, their opponents look physically exhausted, while Pacers were still moving as if the game just started.",@duanewong1527,3,1
You gotta make those 3's to be okc,@rustinpierce7269,0,0
6:07 handoff should’ve been called backcourt. Take those 2 points and OKC wins this game,@JBoy5680,0,2
"The OKC's defense is to ""flood"" the inside of the arc with defense to force outside shots. Their problem with the Pacers is that, Pacers' outside shots go in. That's why their points didn't even exceed 15 pts, which is easier to comeback.",@clonazepm9090,1,1
Okc missed easy looks all game. Might be nerves but okcs defense is going to remain consistent,@na8thegreat,0,1
Can you really call it figuring out their defense if they didn't lead the game once until the last 0.3 seconds? Usually you'd reserve that language for blowouts no?,@27olo27,0,1
"OKC gets away with so much fouling on defense it’s crazy like half of those turnovers were reaches, or they do things like push their man off their spot, and pull arms back to knock balls loose.",@Byronic19134,15,1
Its not that they have figured us out because they haven't its that they see that SGA isn't totally committed to defense and they saw that and wanted to switch to be against him. Perfect example was the switch they created by using a screen to switch wallace with SGA and Nemhard swishes the three in Shai' face,@bboohhmmaann,0,4
Great Analysis / Breakdown 👏 👏 👏,@WorkInProgress-123,1,0
This is some great analysis. It’s cool to see the rest of the world taking a closer look at the Pacers.,@ajfeeneyruiz,6,0
i want the pacers to win so bad,@caydenbyrne1,4,0
lol how did they figure out the defense with 24 turnovers?? If okc turn the majority of those to points it’s a wrap or a blowout let’s be real,@bmillersince92,0,6
Okc played horribly man I’m embarrassed,@prxnceallen,0,6

"The Thunder played awfully. They missed a lot of easy layups. If they had made those layups, the ending could have been different",@el_conde55,2,6
"ig 24 to is figuring it out ? it was just good offense vs good offense in the 4th , not really too good of defense by either team down the stretch",@natsu_anbu,1,0
