"One problem i encountered, a single backspace removes all characters if u dont use windows.setKeyRepeatEnabled.
Is there any alternative way instead of relying on setKeyRepeatEnabled func... 
Not all games rely on a single key hit, i looked up KeyReleased event which can do the same thing as above fun..but cant figure out how to implement it in your code. Any help is appreciated",@aby-ox4kc,0,0

"At 44:42 the logical expression to calculate the middle of the button is correct, however for it to work correctly you have to call setFont() first and then setPosition() in Main.cpp.

I think this is due to the fact that text.GetGlobalBounds() just returns the correct text size value after writing its content, as there is no font when you calculate the position, it doesn't write and the value is 0.",@lusonatuga5741,1,0
