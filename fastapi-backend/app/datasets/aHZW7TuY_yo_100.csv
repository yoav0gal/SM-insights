"Thank you for this. I've been a low level Python developer at my job for a few years now and even some of the 'easy' leetcode problems made me feel dumb and that I'd bomb any technical interview if I changed companies. If you are passionate about coding but aren't mathematically inclined, try to leverage any communication skills you have so that you can show interviewers that while you may not have a Rain-Man level of math skills, you can still reason through a problem(given the resources) and tell them why something is important for end-user reasons.",@jizamurai,3,1

"Commenting even for my own future reference:

I believe the problem arises from rushing. You get stuck in a comfy job, getting a okayish pay but you know you are under paid and deserve more. Suddenly you are browsing linkedin and a friend of yours posts they are starting a new job at a Tier 1 firm and getting good money now. You get frustrated that while you were planning and making strategies, someone outworked you and now is in a better position. 

The frustration is what drives you to pursue the uncharted and now you want to grind leetcode within a month and crack a good company. But to your surprise, since you became comfy, now you lack skills, because your daily job wasn‚Äôt challenging enough. Hence you are not able to solve easy problems which makes you frustrated. Heck you even apply to jobs and get OA links but you see that you are straight away bombing those tests. 

Its mid of 2025 and one has to up their game to stay relevant. These days its easy to ask AI to summarise all of leetcode problems and you can memorise it. But trust me even if you get the job this way, in no way you will survive. 

Thus, my point is, leetcode is often associated with a frustrated engineer. That should not be the case. This video explains it very well. If you don‚Äôt have the habit of comp programming, you will struggle and its fine. Take baby steps to learn the fundamentals and write them down, whatever you learn. Revise Revise and Repeat. If you have good grasping, in a few months you will be in a position to solve mediums quite well. Don‚Äôt be frustrated where you are and by what others are doing. Nobody shows the failures and nobody shows the grind. Keep your head down, be physically and mentally healthy, and study.",@theTranquilYoung,1,0

Grinding Leetcode is not necessary for most full stack jobs, but the speaker will provide simple points on how to approach it effectively.
Learning DSA and core algorithms is still useful, even if it may seem useless, because grinding Leetcode can lead to high-paying job opportunities, as it did for the speaker at Google.
Leetcode is the most academically difficult thing the speaker has ever done, even more so than college, and it is important to understand that it is harder than all other classes and requires perseverance to become familiar with it.

Leetcode can be challenging, but it's not about intelligence, it's about systems and processes, and the speaker learned by going to the solutions tab when stuck on difficult problems.
The speaker discusses using online resources to find solutions and explanations for Leetcode problems, highlighting the importance of finding clear and understandable explanations.
In the past, there was little explanation for Leetcode problems, but now the speaker makes videos to provide intuition and understanding of solutions.

Learning Leetcode is not easy because the methodology of learning it is different from learning math or physics, and it requires a step-by-step process similar to how children learn math.
Practice and repetition are essential for learning and retaining difficult concepts, as simply understanding something once does not guarantee the ability to do it again later.

Master the basics before moving on to more advanced problems, and don't be discouraged if it takes time to understand and solve them.
Repetition and practice are essential for learning Leetcode, and the speaker realized that their previous approach was not sufficient.
Learn and practice core algorithms like binary search and DFS before solving Leetcode problems to improve your skills.

I remember struggling like mad with those """"easy"""" problems, lol. It's not just about brute force memorization but really getting why something works.

Leetcode made me curious back then, I wanted to solve a problem and it was not just for the sake of a job but to be better at problem solving, to be a good enough engineer and partly it was fun too. Fast-forward to present, what seemed to be fun is now because of the pressure of applying for a better job, has become a task.
