"It's also worth mentioning that, unlike in the movie with a bucket and stuff being dragged down in a massive clashing clatter that immediate brings the horde down on the Fellowship, Pippin dropping a rock down a hole, while it does seem to rouse the orcs, only produced some hammer-signals at the time. This occurred days before the mad flight out of the mines; it's likely that, at the time, Pippin's rock was dismissed as just a crumbling bit of stone that fell into the water on its own. While this may have made the orcs a bit more alert, it was not, by itself, the reason that the Fellowship was waylaid or the reason that Gandalf ""died."" It's likely that the orcs nearer the east gate were put on alert by this, though, and caught wind of the Fellowship as they neared the Chamber of Mazarbul.",@OneTrueNobody,0,0

"Sauron likely noticed that Saruman wasn't making his daily appearances which fed his suspicions. Pippin looking into the Isengard Palantir made Sauron think that Saruman had captured the Ring and was holding out on him. He diverted precious resources towards Isengard leaving his border more porous. Then Aragorn looking into the same Palantir caused him to believe the heir of Elendil had captured Isengard, defeated Saruman and had the ring in his possession. Sauron mustered his forces for the final strike for he believed that the Ring was going to be used against him and wanted those resources ready to spill out onto the battlefield at the Black Gates as happened in the last confrontation.

"We named our cats we got in late 2003 and early 04: Merry (the girl), Sam and Pippin. Merry and Sam were both beautiful black cat siblings but Pippin - a jet black Maine Coon,  has some issues: allergic to himself, always making messes and following people - anyone - to the- -bathroom and other extremely weird and odd non-cat behavior. He even went missing for 10 days (this was back in Golden, Colorado so we thought we'd lost him to a coyote!) but he returned! 
Whilst we loved Merry and Sam a lot and those sweet beings both stayed with us until 2022 when they crossed the rainbow bridge, Pippin was truly the heart of the house. Anytime anything was destroyed, broken or messed up we knew 99 times out of 100 which one did it (PIPPIN!) but we also got more affection, love and play from Pip than the others. He made messes, screwed things up and acted like a dog and our motto for him was ""I try. I do not always succeed, but I do try.' We named those three cats very well indeed. Pippy passed away in late 2019.

"Idk. I'd argue Fatty, Sam, and Merry would have got Frodo out of the Shire with or without Pippin. Sam and Merry were far more prominent in organizing the Hobbits against Sharky. Pippin does not say ANYTHING to Treebeard to try and convince him to march on Isengard (and Treebeard says he, and the other Ents, had been considering the matter before the Hobbits arrived). While he did save Beregond, Beregond was ultimately not of any real importance in the grand scheme of things (even if he was a nice guy) and played no real significant role after saving Faramir. Everything ELSE, though, yes. 100% agreed.",@weezact7,0,0
"So, a big change between the books and movies is that, in the books, Merry and Pippin don't really do anything to get the Ents onside. They tell Treebeard about the Uruk-hai and why they were in Fangorn. Treebeard seems to have not known about the Uruk-Hai (as he seems surprised that they can withstand daylight), but he mentions that the Orcs have been going through his Forest and he was suspecting Saruman was behind it. He mentions he has been wondering ""lately"" about whether or not he should do something. It SEEMS like Merry and Pippin's story convinces him he should call the moot, but, at the same time, this is clearly a topic he had already been aware of and pondering for some time before their arrival, unlike the movie. At no point do they say anything to him to encourage him to do anything (I've just re-read the dialogue in the chapter), so their role in his decision is pretty minimal, at best. 

Then Treebeard gets the Ents together and they have their moot which Merry and Pippin attend only briefly before Quickbeam takes them away. The next time Treebeard speaks to them, the Ents have already decided to make war on Isengard (well, actually the NEXT time is a status update and then, two days later, the result)

""Of course, it is likely enough, my friends,' he said slowly, 'likely enough that we are going to our doom: the last march of the Ents. But if we stayed at home and did nothing, doom would find us anyway, sooner or later. That thought has long been growing in our hearts; and that is why we are marching now. It was not a hasty resolve.""",@weezact7,1,1

"One of the best things about TLotR is that, for every single member of the Fellowship (and for several others outside the Fellowship), the answer to the question ""Did X save Middle-Earth?"" the answer is ""yes"". EVERYONE had their role to play and it is made quite clear throughout the story that there was VERY little wiggle room for things to have gone differently. Had any of the Fellowship not been present or not been who they were or done things differently, there's a very real chance the Quest would have failed. But, at the same time, NONE of them did so on their own. NOBODY in the Fellowship can claim full credit for their victory. They all played their roles together even when they were, physically, apart and did not know they were working together.

To provide at least one example for each:
Frodo, obviously, is the Ring-Bearer
Sam gets Frodo to the Crack of Doom
Merry is instrumental in slaying the Witch King
Pippin...is this video. Just watch it.
Gimli rallies the people at Helm's Deep by blowing the horn
Legolas shoots down what was PROBABLY a Nazgul shortly before the breaking of the Fellowship (which likely saved them from being spotted) and may have been the reason the Elves of Lothlorien didn't kill them on sight.
Legolas and Gimli help Aragorn through his entire arc after the breaking of the Fellowship (though, it must be said, they are probably the LEAST influential members of the Fellowship)
Aragorn was, of course, the heir of Isildor and led the party after Gandalf's death
Gandalf was the party leader and the wisest among them
Boromir was the catalyst for Frodo leaving on his own, directed Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli to chase Merry and Pippin, and was probably a major reason for why Aragorn decided to go to Gondor's aid rather than chase Frodo and Sam.",@weezact7,0,0

"5:43 Pippin did not wake the orcs and balrog! It is days between Pippin dropping the stone in the well and the orcs arriving, and both before and after the company was quite loud, bright, and smelly (Gandalf being the worst offender in each case). The stone only got a brief and possibly unrelated response, and realistically, are the goblins going to amass their army for every stone that falls in a massive mine that‚Äôs been neglected for decades at this point? Or perhaps it was the bright lights, singing, shouting, and pipe smoking that got their attention, none of which was from Pippin. It‚Äôs absurd to think that Pip caused it by dropping a pebble.

The time line in the books is as follows:

The company enter Moria with ‚Äúa shattering echo‚Äù and a ‚Äúdull‚Äù sound of ‚Äúrending and crashing‚Äù as the doors slam shut because of the watcher(s) in the water. Gandalf strikes the doors, shaking them and the stairs. 

They climb stairs, have a meal, and then travel again for at least ‚Äúseveral hours‚Äù. 

They are not overly quiet with their voices (especially Gandalf, who has several exclamations and ‚Äúcrie[s]‚Äù), their footfalls are not quiet, and they occasionally had to jump ‚Äúcracks‚Äù and ‚Äúfissures‚Äù in the ground up to 7 feet across, which can‚Äôt have been totally quiet. Gollum‚Äôs footfalls can be heard behind, as well as their own echoes. Gandalf is lighting the way all this time.

They stop in a guard room, and Pippin drops a stone in a well, but only after ‚Äúseveral minutes‚Äù there were a few ‚Äúfaint knocks‚Äù or hammer taps out of the well, which died away ‚Äúafter a while and was not heard again‚Äù. Gandalf says it might not have been related but probably was.

Pippin watches for an hour; then Gandalf for another 6, lighting his pipe for a smoke at the start.

The company travels for another 8 hours (‚Äúnot counting two brief halts‚Äù), covering 15 miles straight, though walking ‚Äútwenty miles or more‚Äù

Company encounters a wide hall, and Gandalf ‚Äúrisk[s] a little real light‚Äù. ‚ÄúA blaze like a flash of lightning‚Äù for ‚Äúa brief instant‚Äù; ‚Äúa second‚Äù. Long and bright enough to illuminate the ‚Äúvast roof far above their heads‚Äù and the pillars holding it, and the ‚Äúhuge‚Äù empty hall making its walls ‚Äúflash[ed] and glitter[ed]‚Äù, and three other entrances

Spent ‚Äúthat night‚Äù huddled in corner of the hall. Gimli ‚Äúchant[s] in a deep voice, while the echoes ran away into the roof‚Äù; the song is a little over a page long. Frodo watched for over two hours, then slept. It was morning when he woke. 

The company ate breakfast, and spent some time looking about (mainly finding and searching the chamber of mazarbul, and reading the book). 

As they go to leave, they hear drums in the depths and a horn and many hurrying feet in the hall. Gandalf instructs Boromir/Aragorn not to close the doors towards the hall, and instead ‚Äúcries‚Äù out of them ‚Äúin a loud voice‚Äù, receiving ‚Äúhoarse laughter‚Äù in return. He thrusts his staff out the doors creating ‚Äúa dazzling flash that lit the chamber and the passage outside‚Äù. Arrows fly past as he steps back from the door.",@thomaswalsh4552,1,0

"""Stay with me on this one."" lol. Okay. I will grant that Pippin's part was more significant than we usually think. Particularly in the books. His looking into the Orthanc stone is far more relevant than the movie showed it. However I'm going to have to disagree with you about Moria. 

To say that his blunder ended up for the best is really stretching credulity. That was a disaster. If he hadn't ever (admittedly accidentally) knocked the armor over might the Fellowship have made it out of Moria never have alerted the orcs and never would have lost Gandalf to the Balrog? It has been one part of the books that I have felt most unrealistic. Jackson showed how that turned out with a thousand orcs raging for their guts. They never should have survived that alone.

Gandalf would have continued on with the Fellowship and who knows how that might have changed the story. Instead the Fellowship ended up broken, everyone running about as it all collapsed. Gandalf lost for good as far as anyone could know. Boromir killed.

Its because he is a natural leader, far better than Gandalf the grey in those aspects. He doesn't make his followes feel that he's keeping secrets and is bold and daring. He would have your back and lead a charge.

"Gandalf falling while defeating the Balrog alone is such an enormous example of the Butterfly Effect:
1. No more Balrog in the mix. Not only was it a very powerful evil thing in its own right, but it would've known Sauron & could easily be assumed to ally with him.
2. Gandalf gets promoted to Gandalf the White. Not only does this replace Saruman & give Gandalf the ability to break his staff & whatnot, but it gives Gandalf the extra powers we see him use openly later. Particularly, during the siege of Minas Tirith.
3. Without Gandalf the White, Rohan would absolutely have fallen. Gandalf & Shadowfax did SO MUCH to save & organize Rohan. Plus, Gandalf saved Th√©oden, which he wouldn't have been able to do as the Grey. 
4. Without both Rohan & Aragorn surviving the battle of Helm's Deep, then Minas Tirith absolutely would have fallen. Also, Gandalf's aforementioned use of power, when he openly defies the Nazg√ªl during the siege.
5. Without both kingdoms prevailing, the hundreds of thousands of Orcs would've been in the way of Frodo & Sam.
6. Faramir is the one who makes the speech that actually convinces everyone to agree that Aragorn deserves the kingship. So, Pippin's distracting Gandalf with saving Faramir essentially allowed for Aragorn to ascend the throne. Also, though it meant the death of Th√©oden, allowing the Witch-king to leave & going to save Faramir actually led to the fall of the Witch-king, despite how Gandalf felt in his choice not to pursue him.",@Richard_Nickerson,2,0

"OK, now I know this one is a re-upload. Moving on, I don't think Pippin deserves the flak he gets over what happened in Moria. He dropped a rock into a well to gauge its depth. So what? Falling rocks are not an uncommon sound in a cave system like the one under Khazad dum, especially when there are hundreds of orcs crawling around like an infestation of rats making all kinds of noise. Furthermore, the trouble didn't start until many miles away the next afternoon. If Pippin were to blame, why were they not attacked as they slept that night? I don't think his rock had anything at all to do with the trouble in Moria, and if not for the absurd way in which he is depicted in the movie I don't think most other LOTR fans would either.",@futuresonex,0,0

"There's another aspect to Pippin dropping that stone down the well in Moria - had he not alerted the orcs and the Balrog to the Fellowship's presence, the Balrog would not have been slain.

So, not only does Pippin's idle curiosity result in Gandalf returning as Gandalf the White, it also results in the removal of the Balrog. What part might the Balrog have played in the War of the Ring? We don't know. It might have simply stayed in Moria. Or it might have come out and assaulted Lothlorien from the slopes of the mountains. Would the Galadhrim have been able to fight on two fronts? Again, we don't know. 

Even if the Balrog played no part on the War, it would still have been hanging around in Moria into the Fourth Age. Moria would thus continue to be a no-go zone. Any orcs that found their way into Moria would have been safe from Aragorn's pogrom.",@nigeldepledge3790,0,0
"Without Pippin knocking that stone/skeleton down the well, Gandalf would never have faced the Balrog and been 'sent back' as Gandalf the White.

"Gandalf, who knows more about hobbits than any of the Wise, has a ""feeling"" about this. At Rivendell, when Elrond suggests replacing Pippin and Merry with perhaps Glorfindel and another elf, Gandalf tells him, even Glorfindel cannot ""open the way to Mordor"" on his own, and that it would be better to ""trust to the hobbits' friendship."" 
After Helm's Deep, on the way back to Edoras when Pippin looks into the palantir, Gandalf admits he was tempted himself to see if this was a Seeing Stone, which would have been disasterous because he would have been drawn into a mental battle with Sauron. Sauron jumps to the wrong conclusion, moving his forces before he planned, and yes, moving his ""Eye"" from protecting Mordor to countering Denethor and Aragorn.
(And at the Moria Gate, Pippin asks Gandalf to explain the elvish script on the doors, and Gandalf gets it wrong. If the elvish script had used standard punctuation, the Fellowship would have entered a lot faster. It wasn't """"Speak, friend, and enter."" It was ""Say 'friend' and enter."" )",@hecate235,0,0

"When he throws a stone down the well in Moria Tolkien, actually quite dry on explanations in Fellowship, Company travels through Moria for four days without many paragraphs of descriptions and notes, deliberately explains that Pippin felt a pull he couldn't resist. It seems to be more than curiosity, but perhaps a mix of evil spread through the world, desiring ruin and influencing Took and a higher Power, rewriting evil into heroic tragedy and success, dualism that sits at the core of Arda. Without monologues behind screen, such scene would look exactly like a curiosity of a cretin many take it for (unless you add menacing whispers of the Ring of course), so it is good that in the movies it is exchanged for clumsiness, not deliberate action.",@DrLicuid,0,0

"It should be noted that Pippin's saving of Faramir had another consequence, in the book.

Faramir, along with √âowyn and Merry, laid stricken in the Houses of Healing at Minas Tirith following the battle of Pelennor Fields, as they had been poisoned by battling the Witch King. Aragorn entered the city to heal them using athelas, which fulfilled a prophecy about the true King of Gondor. As said by the Warden of the Houses: ""The hands of the king are the hands of a healer, and so shall the rightful king be known.""

This immediately led to Faramir recognizing Aragorn as the rightful King, and given that he was a beloved son of Gondor (and technically the last Steward following Denethor's death) would sure have affected the rest of the population. Without this, it may not have been possible for Aragorn to have mustered the remaining forces of Gondor to attack the Black Gate of Mordor; without an army, Sauron may not have been convinced of the legitimacy of the attack and thus moved his own forces to counter, which opened the way for Frodo and Sam to reach Mount Doom.",@Yonkage-ik5qb,0,0

"In my opinion Pippin‚Äôs most critical achievement was through accident - picking up the palantir, which caused Sauron to launch his first assault early. Without it, it‚Äôs likely that Frodo is captured when the Witch King is still in Minas Morgul.

His second most important achievement was his actions that led to the recruitment of the Ents. Without them, Rohan either loses the Battle of Helm‚Äôs Deep or they win with greater losses and they are forced to withhold a much greater body of troops to defend against an unconquered Isengard, resulting in the fall of Minas Tirith - or much greater loss of life - in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Remember that the Ents killed huge numbers of orcs retreating from Helm‚Äôs Deep in terror. If they were not mopped up they could have regrouped and formed a very serious threat.",@andyl8055,0,0
