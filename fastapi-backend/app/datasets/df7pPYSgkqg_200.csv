Very late comment but for those who doesn't understand how to fight the blaze guardians in day 16. All you have to do is wait until they stop being on fire then attack. The shields are also worthless on the blaze all you've gotta do is hit it on the head and it won't block your attacks. It's honestly one of the easier mobs in AdventureZ imo,@yourdailyrandom5434,1,4

"17:27 hi im going to make a REALLY LONG COMMENT because some people cant tell the difference between  deliberately unfair game design and a hardcore game.  

So lets examine how this kind of attack is completely unjustified in a hardcore gamemode.  Not from a standpoint of “how do i think  hardcore should be played” but purely from a game design perspective.  

Yes the point of hardcore is to die and loose everything.  HOWEVER that generally operates under the assumption that the player is extremely experienced in all aspects of the game, enough to warrant the punishment.  this here is un-telegraphed, unpredictable, and a completely unnecessary waste of the player’s one life.  It isn’t “kill the player as punishment for being reckless or careless”.   It isnt “kill them and teach them what they did wrong”.  Here, it is a spontaneous and unpredictable death, that completely resets all progression as punishment instead of teaching the player how to not make the mistake again.

This isnt a “difficult challenge” or a dangerous enemy, this is just BS difficulty because the mod developer assumed everyone would automatically know how to fight it properly.  Its a trial by fire.  It looks a lot like a blaze, so the fact it cant be fought like one is a completely jarring turn.  And odds are that by the time the player learns that they cant use traditional techniques, they are already dead and on a subsequent WORLD.  Not a subsequent set of gear.  A subsequent run entirely.  A punishment for a failure they didn’t see coming. And were unable to prepare for. 


Even a range of experienced players would probably immediately die to this without any indication that the enemy is such a terrible threat.  


To make a guarantee one shot attack fair in a game that isn’t inherently designed to consistently and randomly kill a player, like “I want to be the guy” it needs to be able to be anticipated in Some regard IN A BLIND RUN.

For example, in Souls games, the vast majority of enemies and bosses can indeed one or two shot a player.  But they have a dedicated pattern that can he learned with enough trial and error.  These games also dont tend to send you completely back to the beginning of the campaign with one death.  They have checkpoints periodically placed throughout.  This means that it allows the player some room to actually learn the enemy patterns and accommodate themselves to when they need to dodge or retreat to avoid these deaths.

The entire reason totems of undying exist in hardcore minecraft is to help offer this leeway to learn about how to combat a threat.  It’s not to “keep you forever immortal in hardcore”.  it’s to “enable a player to actually adapt to a threat they were unaware of or were unprepared for”. Sure you can farm totems.  But thats due to exploiting their renewability.  A renewability in place so that they don’t completely run out in a long standing or multiplayer world.  Which would effectively render the entire mechanic obsolete or ineffective at some point.  

This is what’s referred to as a “pity mechanic” and as stared, even Souls games have these features. When you take these things, like armor, totems, etc, and completely ignore them out of the blue, it is almost NEVER fair.

Even BOSSES in normal Minecraft  don’t do that.  They at least let you tank a hit in full enchanted Diamond and attempt to run.  

With all this said, it really shouldn’t have been labeled as hardcore if he was going to cheat death.  However it is at least UNDERSTANDABLE (not okay, but understandable) in a slight sense here as he didn’t cheat death outside of a brutally unfair and poorly designed enemy encounter.",@terminalvelocityrunner2202,18,0
