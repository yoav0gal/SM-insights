"I’m so happy you got to play as a tiny origin! I primarily play a Kelperet (like a tiny merling), and I LOVE it. Having tiny hideouts in my builds where my sister can’t go is so fun. I do wish I could climb blocks… or swim :b",@theseawriter,1,0

Very late comment but for those who doesn't understand how to fight the blaze guardians in day 16. All you have to do is wait until they stop being on fire then attack. The shields are also worthless on the blaze all you've gotta do is hit it on the head and it won't block your attacks. It's honestly one of the easier mobs in AdventureZ imo,@yourdailyrandom5434,1,4
