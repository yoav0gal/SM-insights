Cluster the comments based on topic/theme.

For each clustering, provide a list of group names/labels and the number of comments in each group.

You must perform recursive hierarchical clustering:
- Each cluster should contain:
  - label: a descriptive name of the theme
  - count: total number of comments in this cluster
  - examples: 2â€“3 representative comment strings
  - subClusters: an array of child clusters in the same format

Each subCluster must follow the same structure and may include additional subClusters as needed, recursively. Continue drilling down until no meaningful subdivisions remain.

Respond in JSON format:

{ 
  label: string, 
  count: number, 
  examples: string[], 
  subClusters?: ClusterResult[] // For hierarchical clustering
}[]
